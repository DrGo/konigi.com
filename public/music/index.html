<p class="intro">This is my music blog, where I write about learning about music production and song writing. You can listen to my <a href="mixes" rel="bookmark" title="Mixes">mixes in Mixcloud</a> and hear my naive experiments with making <a href="songs" rel="bookmark" title="Songs">songs in my Soundcloud</a> page.</p>

    <section class="article-body"><p>I&rsquo;ve hinted at starting to play with music for a little while now. I&rsquo;ve gotten past the point of just being overwhelmed and uncertain about whether I can learn to create music, and am now immersed in learning. Here&rsquo;s the story, and why you may start to see me blog about music now.</p>

<p>In 2013 I committed to teaching a mixing (DJing) workshop to a group of colleagues, having rediscovered mixing with digital music. I mixed house and electronic music as a teenager (because Filipino) and college student, and then bedroom DJ through the years until I settled into an IA/IXD career, had kids, etc. I returned to bedroom DJ status when I acquired Traktor, and that&rsquo;s rekindled the love I have for electronic music.</p>

<p>In the year since I started mixing again, I&rsquo;ve rediscovered a love for deep house, techno, ambient, and electronic music in general. I found a wonderful piano teacher where I live and have been taking piano lessons and learning music production. This year I made a commitment to start making my own music with the goal of putting it on the Internet.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something gratifying about the beginning of a new project. Learning a new skill from zero feels daunting. I have some history and references to draw upon. I&rsquo;ve begun to study and do research to become steeped in the language and tools of the craft. I&rsquo;ve started to read everything I can find about creators in that field, and yearn to know how they create. I realize with excitement that there is a lot to learn.</p>

<p>I think some people find it odd that I&rsquo;m starting this new pursuit this late in life. The best way I know how to deal with an itch is to scratch it. So I&rsquo;m starting this music blog to share my thoughts in this new pursuit. I&rsquo;m already finding a lot of spillover into other creative work as I do this, so maybe that will be interesting to others. For some, this may be a reason to stop following this blog, and I fully understand.</p>

<p>For those that stick around, thanks for taking the time to read this and explore with me. -Michael</p>
