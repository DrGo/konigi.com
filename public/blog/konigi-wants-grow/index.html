  <h2 class="post-title">Konigi Wants to Grow</h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>I'm going to be tearing things up a little while Konigi gets a clue about what it is. I started playing with this blog in Nov 07 as a more organized way of doing my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/sets/72157600094498222/">visual design</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/designpatterns/">user interface design</a> sets on Flickr, and think it's still going well. But over time I've found myself drawn to re-blogging and writing the occasional essay, reminding me of my first try at blogging when I did iaslash. And then the old sketchbooks full of ideas that came out of all those great conversations with IAI peeps in Monterrey and my iaslash readers kept returning, and I found myself wanting to find time to work on some micro-projects to build IA/IXD tools.</p>
<p>It's been a little over a year since I started announced Konigi, and it feels like time to take this site a bit more seriously and use it as a platform for other kinds of the learning, sharing, and collection of resources that I've wanted to do for some time. Konigi wants to be better and do more with its life. So I'm going to start with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/3344620893/">a few little design tweaks</a> and evolve the site organically as time becomes available to help this baby along. </p>
<p>So what's coming? I have a series of instructional essays that I've outlined and have started writing. I have a wonderful new community project planned that that will be possible through Peldi Guilizzoni, the gracious and talented creator of <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products">Balsamiq</a>. And I'm going to play at opening up the site a little more until stuff gets broken. The Modus Operandi will be to just do stuff rather than doing so much thinking and talking, to do it wrong, to fail, to have people mock me, and be left standing at the end. As always, I plan to give away some stuff, charge a little for other stuff, and push a few smallish projects forward with the help of friends to fill gaps where we need educational/learning resources.</p>
<p>Finally, I personally want to do more and contribute more outside of this community, and I'm hoping to find a way to give away more to people in need. The sale of things on this site has really taken me by surprise and now I want to do something better and more meaningful if I'm in a position to do so. I'm still not sure what I'm going to do, but when the idea begins to take shape I'll let you know what that's all about. </p>
<p>So onward. Grow up little, Konigi. Make something of yourself.</p>
