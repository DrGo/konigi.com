    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/jim-kalbach-jazz/">Jim Kalbach on Jazz as a Model for the Way Businesses Work</a></h2>
    <section class="article-body"><div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j8Gmp194zbI?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p><a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Jazz-Improvisation-as-a-Model-f;search%3Ajazz">Jim Kalbach talks</a> about the improvisational model of Jazz as a metaphor for the way some businesses approach collaboration today. What was probably seen a few years ago as a radical way of structuring companies to organize around the work rather than using inflexible business units as boundaries, is now more commonplace.</p>

<p>To demonstrate what happens in the teamwork of a group of jazz performers, Kalbach assembled a group of musicians to perform a song they hadn&rsquo;t played together before, and described how jazz performances &ldquo;work&rdquo; as a type of collaboration. These are the characteristics we can learn from.</p>

<p>Empathy: Everyone brings something unique to the performance, but it&rsquo;s only when the individuals come together that great music happens. So while Jazz performers allows for individuality to shine through, it&rsquo;s in the listening and working with each musician&rsquo;s solo that the whole emerges.</p>

<p>Embracing uncertainty: The idea of approaching each performance with an expectation that what may unfold is unknown means that performers can experiment and improvise.</p>

<p>Lastly, improvisation in a team doesn&rsquo;t mean doing as you please. Without some rules or guidelines, it&rsquo;d be easier to make a mess than music worth listening to. It could be a set of patterns, guidelines, and principles that set the stage for the work to be done. In jazz it can mean using song structure like working within the AABA song pattern so that the musicians have queues for how the individual moments can be framed. It can also mean having principles that the players have a common understanding of, so they can work with how the others&rsquo; use them.</p>

<p>These three points can be easily applied to how businesses organize and do work. I like the chart he shows, giving a snapshot of how <a href="https://ucvox.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/113617905-scaling-agile-spotify-11.pdf">Spotify&rsquo;s organic Guild structure (PDF)</a> has allowed their Agile teams to make do with a fast growing company. It&rsquo;s a great example showing how a business organizes teams into organic groups around projects. This makes it possible to flex with the constantly changing organization and business goals in order to get things done. This way of working is the antithesis of what Kalbach refers to as the command and control model of work from the Drucker age of business management for information work. The work becomes more important as does embracing the uncertainty of flatter and continuously morphing teams.</p>

<p>Where I work, a lot of our inspiration comes from the same examples of companies that Kalbach references like Gore and Valve&ndash;companies that have created flatter, work-oriented teams where the focus on how the company works is as important as the products. Our founder Peldi&rsquo;s greatest achievement in many of our opinions is not the product, but the company he&rsquo;s created. Our most interesting meetings have been discussion focussed on continuous improvement, rather than anything related to technology.</p>

<p>This is an inspiring presentation, and I love the connection made with Jazz performance. You can see more talks from Jim at his blog <a href="https://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/">Experiencing Information</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/hello-hugo/">Hello Hugo: Konigi is now a Static Site</a></h2>
    <section class="article-body">

<p>After many years of being a Drupal user, from version 2 when I started iaslash.org to version 6 on this site, I&rsquo;ve made the move from PHP/MySQL blog to full on static site. Here&rsquo;s why and how I did it.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-static-site-generators:559804b0a39dd16d2d1d1238c597145a">Choosing Static Site Generators</h3>

<p>In the past few years, I&rsquo;ve taken a few sites backwards from Drupal and WordPress into the age of static sites. In many ways, it feels like going back to the beginning of my career, when I used Perl and Shell scripts to generate sites in my first job, and later to more sophisticated site generation using MovableType as a middle man.</p>

<p>As each of the small personal projects I&rsquo;ve worked on became bigger, I started to miss how simple things used to be, and loathe how much I had to babysit my site or pay a lot for better cloud MySQL instances. In my day job, we also had to deal with the regular security patches on WP and Drupal, and it became a drag.</p>

<p>I started our first experiment by moving a site to Hammer, then shortly after moved it to become a grunt generated site. Those sites are happily chugging along, maintained by a team that generates the pages with grunt. Our main site at <a href="http://balsamiq.com">balsamiq.com</a> is one of them.</p>

<p>After that year or so of being happy with how simple those site are to maintain, I started looking at more powerful <a href="/tools/submissions/static-site-generator-directories/">static site generators</a> and finally migrated this site content off of Drupal so it can be used by a static generator. I now use <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> to generate the few thousand pages of this site in a few seconds and sync it to AWS S3 using their static site hosting options.</p>

<p><a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is a generator written in the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> programming language. I chose Hugo over a few of the other great options out there like Jekkyl and Octopress because of its speed, support for taxonomies, and markdown support. I&rsquo;m no programmer, so my implementation of Hugo is very simple and I put together my theme using only the examples in the docs, and a couple of questions to the discussion forum.</p>

<p>I still haven&rsquo;t gotten my head around how to do more complex things yet, and I don&rsquo;t want to be the newb that inundates the forum with dense questions. If you happen to find yourself in that forum you&rsquo;ll see how little I understand, despite reading docs. But for now, after a few weeks of work with only a few days of template building, it&rsquo;s doing nearly everything I did in Drupal, with none of the overhead.</p>

<h3 id="migrating-content-off-drupal:559804b0a39dd16d2d1d1238c597145a">Migrating Content Off Drupal</h3>

<p>To get started, I created a modified version of my Drupal theme that exports all of my content to text files. I removed all the views and only exported the actual node contents. Each node includes Hugo&rsquo;s &ldquo;front matter&rdquo; at the top of each page. This is the metadata that describes title, tags, permalink slug, and publish date. I pared down my taxonomy use on this site to one tag taxonomy for the time being to simplify things. I had taxonomies for people, company, color, etc.</p>

<p>After testing to see that what I output was formatted to properly get read by Hugo, I then used <a href="http://www.httrack.com/">httrack</a> to download all of the nodes of content to my machine. Each file was downloaded into a subfolder for the corresponding sections used by the global nav and the url paths on the site. I ran the files all through a file renamer to add .md (markdown) extensions. I use <a href="http://manytricks.com/namemangler/">Name Mangler</a> on the Mac for renaming.</p>

<p>These articles helped with figuring out the export part of the process.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lullabot.com/blog/article/sending-drupal-site-retirement">Sending a Drupal Site Into Retirement</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/27882">Creating a static archive of a Drupal site</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="building-it-in-hugo:559804b0a39dd16d2d1d1238c597145a">Building it in Hugo</h3>

<p>Next step was to install Hugo and generate a basic Hugo site with the .md files I downloaded. The <a href="http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/">Hugo docs</a> show you how to create a Hugo site and install a theme. I did this first to test out the content. Then I started learning how templates work and built my own straight from the docs, looking at a few examples to figure out how to create taxonomy views. I started with a skeleton template that just spits out a nav and bodies, then made some section views.</p>

<p>Next was CSS/JS asset management. I copied over my SASS files and JS. I also decided to switch from the Bootstrap grid to Foundation, so I stripped down a lot of styles and the layout. After years of changing layout ideas, it&rsquo;s nice to trim the SASS layout files down to nothing.</p>

<p>To manage the pre-processing, minifying and building of JS and SASS/CSS I had to set up a task manager. I decided to learn how Gulp handles this compared to Grunt, and I like how simple and clean my Gulpfile.js is. It works about the same as Grunt, so there was little to learn there. <a href="http://markgoodyear.com/2014/01/getting-started-with-gulp/">This post on getting started with gulp</a> is good if all you&rsquo;re interested in is processing Sass. There&rsquo;s plenty of StackOverflow articles on processing JS. I only run gulp whenever I make a change to JS or SASS which is rare, and the minified files get included with the Hugo build command.</p>

<p>My process for writing new content now is to start up Atom, create a new .md file in the appropriate directory, then run &ldquo;hugo server &ndash;watch&rdquo; to test it. When I&rsquo;m happy with my writing, I run &ldquo;hugo&rdquo; to build files into my /public directory and I&rsquo;m ready to deploy.</p>

<p>The last step is a command that uses <a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd">s3cmd</a> to sync only the changed pages to the generated public directory, removing deletions. See the options in the docs for doing this. There are many blog posts with different suggestions for how to deploy, but I found all I needed <a href="http://www.programblings.com/2013/07/12/hosting-a-website-on-s3/">in this one on Programblings</a>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done to date and it&rsquo;s working well. My next steps are to get my content, which is on Git, hooked up to a middleman that will automate the deploy part of the process. If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing how I created this site, you can look at my theme templates. The entire site is publicly <a href="https://github.com/jibbajabba/konigi.com/tree/master/themes/konigi">viewable on Github</a>.</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;m very happy, and after a few years of trying different tools, this set feels right&hellip; until the next change. The older I get, however, the less I want to waste time on stuff like this, so it feels like a keeper. Huge thanks to <a href="http://spf13.com/">Steve Francia</a> for creating Hugo and to everyone who contribute to it. If a simple-minded UX designer like me can use it, that&rsquo;s saying a lot.</p>

    <section class="article-body"><p>Aral Balkan’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/106681730">“I, Simulation”</a> talk about the current state of privacy and freedom in software and services is one the best presentations I’ve watched this year. Balkan talks about business models that focus on user data, and what that can mean to your "privacy."  Watch the talk below, given at Open Exchange in Munich, Germany. </p>

<div class="video"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/106681730?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>The information you hand over using service providers like Facebook (think also Messenger, Whatsapp, Instagram) and Google (think also Gmail, Hangouts, Android Devices, Drive, Nest, Dropcam, and Fiber) is already being used to create simulations of you, and he likens this use to spyware. It's a business model of "corporate surveillance." He quotes Eric Schmidt, who says Google can already predict some of what you're doing to do. Balkan says that all that is missing in these simulations is your body, and these representations of you have no rights. </p>
<p>He poses some challenges to what this means as services get more and more inside of your home and your behaviors and where their involvement becomes less and less apparent. In the end, he is making an argument for what the alternatives are to shift the ownership and control of consumer technology and data from corporations to individuals. You can <a href="https://ind.ie/manifesto/">read the ind.ie manifesto</a> for more about how his company is planning to do that. </p>
<p>Recently there's <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/09/25/ello-investor-co-founder-funding-or-not-we-hate-ads-and-we-want-to-shift-values/">been</a> <a href="https://aralbalkan.com/notes/ello-goodbye/">some</a> <a href="https://medium.com/message/what-does-ethical-social-networking-software-look-like-315373c898ed">discussion</a> over what should be apparent to users when they engage in new social software apps. People want to know if someone has already taken VC funding, versus making a statement about being bootstrapped with the goal of not flipping or exiting. When a new business is admitting to taking funding, there's an assumption that user data will eventually go elsewhere. The right thing to do is be upfront about that. There's really no guarantee that your data won't be used in ways you don't expect even when a company provides a Manifesto with all their good intentions. The firmly expressed statement in Balkan's Manifesto seems genuine and a better "my word is my bond" indicator than the absence of transparency up front about taking VC funding in the case of Ello. Who knows? </p>
<p>It's been interesting reading what others think of this. While I'm a user of businesses where corporate surveillance is a model, I love not working for a business that monetizes its users data. I realize that not everyone cares about this, and picking who you get to work for is a luxury. I'm personally looking forward to seeing how <a href="https://ind.ie/">ind.ie</a> are going to make their goals happen. </p>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/stinie">@stinie</a> for the recommendation. </p>

The product consists of a video sensor and interactive pen. You have to have a projector as well. Here's a super rough demo I made for my team at Balsamiq to show how it would work using Balsamiq Mockups.</p>
<div class="video"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/101344544" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>While the demo is pretty rough given the 15 minutes I gave myself to set up and record with my phone, it's pretty interesting to consider the possibilities for whiteboarding with wireframing software, if you're so inclined. I used a regular painted wall, but I'm going to give it a try on a real whiteboard. </p>

wt53cda276915a2_large.jpg'/></a></div><p>This is a cool <a href="http://www.djtechtools.com/2014/07/17/what-if-other-dj-controllers-pioneer-native-instruments-vestax-had-built-in-screens/">design challenge</a> that showed up on DJ Tech Tools&rsquo; blog to mock up DJ controllers. DJ gear vendor <a href="http://www.djtechtools.com/2014/07/14/numark-nv-dj-controller-full-color-screens-built-in/">Numark is reported</a> to be releasing a controller with a screen. That&rsquo;s kind of interesting, because it could potentially let digital DJs that use them close their computer screen and focus on performing.</p></p>

<p>While there are CDJs that already have color LCDs to preview deck track information, midi controllers are largely comprised of faders, buttons, knobs, toggle switches, jog wheels, and touch sensitive strips. At most they provide color LED feedback behind translucent silicon buttons, and as far I can tell from what I've read they haven't had display screens yet.  Perhaps overall cost for the hardware is coming down, making it possible to deliver screens into more products. Thanks, Moore's Law.</p>

<p>DJ Tech Tools put up some Photoshop assets for its users to imagine what the other existing DJ controllers would look like if they had screens. It's kind of fun watching the DJ community come up with ideas. I see a some concepts that feel over-loaded. Hardware is interesting because more buttons/knobs for dedicated access to functions can be better, but there comes a point where I imagine ease of access to essential functions can be lost when too many secondary ones are added. There's a sweet spot between the minimalist DJ setup and the advanced/expert user that I imagine makes for some difficult product discussions at these companies.</p>
