    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/hello-hugo/">Hello Hugo: Konigi is now a Static Site</a></h2>
    <section class="article-body">

<p>After many years of being a Drupal user, from version 2 when I started iaslash.org to version 6 on this site, I&rsquo;ve made the move from PHP/MySQL blog to full on static site. Here&rsquo;s why and how I did it.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-static-site-generators:559804b0a39dd16d2d1d1238c597145a">Choosing Static Site Generators</h3>

<p>In the past few years, I&rsquo;ve taken a few sites backwards from Drupal and WordPress into the age of static sites. In many ways, it feels like going back to the beginning of my career, when I used Perl and Shell scripts to generate sites in my first job, and later to more sophisticated site generation using MovableType as a middle man.</p>

<p>As each of the small personal projects I&rsquo;ve worked on became bigger, I started to miss how simple things used to be, and loathe how much I had to babysit my site or pay a lot for better cloud MySQL instances. In my day job, we also had to deal with the regular security patches on WP and Drupal, and it became a drag.</p>

<p>I started our first experiment by moving a site to Hammer, then shortly after moved it to become a grunt generated site. Those sites are happily chugging along, maintained by a team that generates the pages with grunt. Our main site at <a href="http://balsamiq.com">balsamiq.com</a> is one of them.</p>

<p>After that year or so of being happy with how simple those site are to maintain, I started looking at more powerful <a href="/tools/submissions/static-site-generator-directories/">static site generators</a> and finally migrated this site content off of Drupal so it can be used by a static generator. I now use <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> to generate the few thousand pages of this site in a few seconds and sync it to AWS S3 using their static site hosting options.</p>

<p><a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is a generator written in the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> programming language. I chose Hugo over a few of the other great options out there like Jekkyl and Octopress because of its speed, support for taxonomies, and markdown support. I&rsquo;m no programmer, so my implementation of Hugo is very simple and I put together my theme using only the examples in the docs, and a couple of questions to the discussion forum.</p>

<p>I still haven&rsquo;t gotten my head around how to do more complex things yet, and I don&rsquo;t want to be the newb that inundates the forum with dense questions. If you happen to find yourself in that forum you&rsquo;ll see how little I understand, despite reading docs. But for now, after a few weeks of work with only a few days of template building, it&rsquo;s doing nearly everything I did in Drupal, with none of the overhead.</p>

<h3 id="migrating-content-off-drupal:559804b0a39dd16d2d1d1238c597145a">Migrating Content Off Drupal</h3>

<p>To get started, I created a modified version of my Drupal theme that exports all of my content to text files. I removed all the views and only exported the actual node contents. Each node includes Hugo&rsquo;s &ldquo;front matter&rdquo; at the top of each page. This is the metadata that describes title, tags, permalink slug, and publish date. I pared down my taxonomy use on this site to one tag taxonomy for the time being to simplify things. I had taxonomies for people, company, color, etc.</p>

<p>After testing to see that what I output was formatted to properly get read by Hugo, I then used <a href="http://www.httrack.com/">httrack</a> to download all of the nodes of content to my machine. Each file was downloaded into a subfolder for the corresponding sections used by the global nav and the url paths on the site. I ran the files all through a file renamer to add .md (markdown) extensions. I use <a href="http://manytricks.com/namemangler/">Name Mangler</a> on the Mac for renaming.</p>

<p>These articles helped with figuring out the export part of the process.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lullabot.com/blog/article/sending-drupal-site-retirement">Sending a Drupal Site Into Retirement</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/27882">Creating a static archive of a Drupal site</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="building-it-in-hugo:559804b0a39dd16d2d1d1238c597145a">Building it in Hugo</h3>

<p>Next step was to install Hugo and generate a basic Hugo site with the .md files I downloaded. The <a href="http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/">Hugo docs</a> show you how to create a Hugo site and install a theme. I did this first to test out the content. Then I started learning how templates work and built my own straight from the docs, looking at a few examples to figure out how to create taxonomy views. I started with a skeleton template that just spits out a nav and bodies, then made some section views.</p>

<p>Next was CSS/JS asset management. I copied over my SASS files and JS. I also decided to switch from the Bootstrap grid to Foundation, so I stripped down a lot of styles and the layout. After years of changing layout ideas, it&rsquo;s nice to trim the SASS layout files down to nothing.</p>

<p>To manage the pre-processing, minifying and building of JS and SASS/CSS I had to set up a task manager. I decided to learn how Gulp handles this compared to Grunt, and I like how simple and clean my Gulpfile.js is. It works about the same as Grunt, so there was little to learn there. <a href="http://markgoodyear.com/2014/01/getting-started-with-gulp/">This post on getting started with gulp</a> is good if all you&rsquo;re interested in is processing Sass. There&rsquo;s plenty of StackOverflow articles on processing JS. I only run gulp whenever I make a change to JS or SASS which is rare, and the minified files get included with the Hugo build command.</p>

<p>My process for writing new content now is to start up Atom, create a new .md file in the appropriate directory, then run &ldquo;hugo server &ndash;watch&rdquo; to test it. When I&rsquo;m happy with my writing, I run &ldquo;hugo&rdquo; to build files into my /public directory and I&rsquo;m ready to deploy.</p>

<p>The last step is a command that uses <a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd">s3cmd</a> to sync only the changed pages to the generated public directory, removing deletions. See the options in the docs for doing this. There are many blog posts with different suggestions for how to deploy, but I found all I needed <a href="http://www.programblings.com/2013/07/12/hosting-a-website-on-s3/">in this one on Programblings</a>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done to date and it&rsquo;s working well. My next steps are to get everything on Git and hooked up to a middleman that will automate the deploy part of the process. So far I&rsquo;m very happy, and after a few years of trying different tools, this set feels right&hellip; until the next change. The older I get, however, the less I want to waste time on stuff like this, so it feels like a keeper. Huge thanks to <a href="http://spf13.com/">Steve Francia</a> for creating Hugo and to everyone who contribute to it. If a simple-minded UX designer like me can use it, that&rsquo;s saying a lot.</p>

    <section class="article-body"><p>Aral Balkan’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/106681730">“I, Simulation”</a> talk about the current state of privacy and freedom in software and services is one the best presentations I’ve watched this year. Balkan talks about business models that focus on user data, and what that can mean to your "privacy."  Watch the talk below, given at Open Exchange in Munich, Germany. </p>

<div class="video"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/106681730?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>The information you hand over using service providers like Facebook (think also Messenger, Whatsapp, Instagram) and Google (think also Gmail, Hangouts, Android Devices, Drive, Nest, Dropcam, and Fiber) is already being used to create simulations of you, and he likens this use to spyware. It's a business model of "corporate surveillance." He quotes Eric Schmidt, who says Google can already predict some of what you're doing to do. Balkan says that all that is missing in these simulations is your body, and these representations of you have no rights. </p>
<p>He poses some challenges to what this means as services get more and more inside of your home and your behaviors and where their involvement becomes less and less apparent. In the end, he is making an argument for what the alternatives are to shift the ownership and control of consumer technology and data from corporations to individuals. You can <a href="https://ind.ie/manifesto/">read the ind.ie manifesto</a> for more about how his company is planning to do that. </p>
<p>Recently there's <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/09/25/ello-investor-co-founder-funding-or-not-we-hate-ads-and-we-want-to-shift-values/">been</a> <a href="https://aralbalkan.com/notes/ello-goodbye/">some</a> <a href="https://medium.com/message/what-does-ethical-social-networking-software-look-like-315373c898ed">discussion</a> over what should be apparent to users when they engage in new social software apps. People want to know if someone has already taken VC funding, versus making a statement about being bootstrapped with the goal of not flipping or exiting. When a new business is admitting to taking funding, there's an assumption that user data will eventually go elsewhere. The right thing to do is be upfront about that. There's really no guarantee that your data won't be used in ways you don't expect even when a company provides a Manifesto with all their good intentions. The firmly expressed statement in Balkan's Manifesto seems genuine and a better "my word is my bond" indicator than the absence of transparency up front about taking VC funding in the case of Ello. Who knows? </p>
<p>It's been interesting reading what others think of this. While I'm a user of businesses where corporate surveillance is a model, I love not working for a business that monetizes its users data. I realize that not everyone cares about this, and picking who you get to work for is a luxury. I'm personally looking forward to seeing how <a href="https://ind.ie/">ind.ie</a> are going to make their goals happen. </p>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/stinie">@stinie</a> for the recommendation. </p>

<div class="video"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/101344544" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>While the demo is pretty rough given the 15 minutes I gave myself to set up and record with my phone, it's pretty interesting to consider the possibilities for whiteboarding with wireframing software, if you're so inclined. I used a regular painted wall, but I'm going to give it a try on a real whiteboard. </p>

DJ gear vendor <a href="http://www.djtechtools.com/2014/07/14/numark-nv-dj-controller-full-color-screens-built-in/">Numark is reported</a> to be releasing a controller with a screen. That&rsquo;s kind of interesting, because it could potentially let digital DJs that use them close their computer screen and focus on performing.</p></p>

<p>While there are CDJs that already have color LCDs to preview deck track information, midi controllers are largely comprised of faders, buttons, knobs, toggle switches, jog wheels, and touch sensitive strips. At most they provide color LED feedback behind translucent silicon buttons, and as far I can tell from what I've read they haven't had display screens yet.  Perhaps overall cost for the hardware is coming down, making it possible to deliver screens into more products. Thanks, Moore's Law.</p>

<p>DJ Tech Tools put up some Photoshop assets for its users to imagine what the other existing DJ controllers would look like if they had screens. It's kind of fun watching the DJ community come up with ideas. I see a some concepts that feel over-loaded. Hardware is interesting because more buttons/knobs for dedicated access to functions can be better, but there comes a point where I imagine ease of access to essential functions can be lost when too many secondary ones are added. There's a sweet spot between the minimalist DJ setup and the advanced/expert user that I imagine makes for some difficult product discussions at these companies.</p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/99u-master-class-irene-au-mindfulness-techniques-make-you-better-creative/">99u Master Class: Irene Au on Mindfulness Techniques to Make You a Better Creative</a></h2>
    <section class="article-body"><p><p><a href="http://blog.ireneau.com/">Irene Au</a> was a design and user experience leader at Google, Yahoo, and Netscape. She&rsquo;s now a partner at Khosla Ventures, and has been focussing on her yoga instruction in the past few years. She led a session at the 99u Conference to discuss mindfulness mediation techniques for creatives.</p>
<p>Au talked about different methods of mindfulness mediation practice. Mindfulness, in general, is a state of awareness or consciousness of the present moment. Mindfulness mediation comes from the Buddhist practice of controlling the mind, and uses awareness of the present as a form of meditation.</p>
<p>Au talked about benefits of mindfulness practice, including references to scientific research, use in treating psychological issues. Mindfulness practice is also becoming more of a secular, mainstream topic appearing in the media frequently, including a <a href="http://time.com/1556/the-mindful-revolution/">Time Magazine feature</a> on mindfulness. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Kabat-Zinn">Jon Kabat-Zinn&rsquo;s</a> work on bringing mindfulness meditation to non-Buddhists for its benefits in stress reduction is only one example. </p>
<p>Mindfulness meditation is an element that Au uses in her yoga practice and suggests that we might also be able to practice mindfulness practices to improve our work.</p>
<p>She introduced us to the different techniques of mindfulness mediation. In focussed attention meditation, one can choose to focus attention on one thing. In open monitoring meditation, one may allow the mind to wander and observe without reacting or judging. In both, the focus and awareness of breath and body, bring the mind back to the present.</p>
<p>The audience participated in several mindfulness activities. The first exercise was a warm up. We all practiced yoga breathing with eyes closed, while being aware of our presence in our seats in the room and building. We used counting with our breath to bring awareness back to the room when we wandered. </p>
<p>She pointed out that sitting meditation can help us in daily life in several ways:</p>
<ul><li>Enhances single to noise contrast</li><li>Recover from distraction</li><li>Improve cognitive capacities (decision making, perspective taking, memory)</li><li>Emotion stabilization</li></ul>
<p>The second activity was the one that interested me most. Au is a journal writer, and she talked about how she has used journal writing most of her life. I liked the idea of daily journal writing to help get perspective. I once tried morning journaling after starting to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Artists-Way-Julia-Cameron/dp/1585421464">The Artists Way</a> a long time ago, but didn&rsquo;t get through that book, and that sort of journaling felt forced to me. Using journaling to just record and observe the thoughts and activities of the day feels more natural.</p>
<p>The audience was asked to spend several minutes writing in our journals, finishing each of these sentences. </p>
<ul><li>When I feel understood, I&hellip;</li><li>When I&rsquo;m at my best, I&hellip;</li><li>What I really care about is&hellip;</li></ul>
<p>Then we spent the next few minutes taking turns telling the person sitting next to us what we wrote about to complete the first sentence. That listener would then take a few minutes to repeat back to the teller what they heard. This was a fantastic exercise in listening, and reminds me of the practice of reflecting back to someone what they hear when expressing needs, something I learned from Marshall Rosenberg&rsquo;s book on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">Nonviolent Communication</a>. </p>
<p>I think this practice of intently listening to someone and repeating back is something that can be very difficult to become comfortable with, but the reward is invaluable. It is a gift, and is something I highly recommend doing with your partner/spouse or children. We do this in my family, and I can&rsquo;t tell you how much it has helped during difficult times. Doing it in the work day can be very valuable in helping practice empathy and is something that I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people who do research are already comfortable with. I recommend Rosenberg&rsquo;s book because of this, if you&rsquo;re comfortable getting uncomfortable. It&rsquo;s not easy to use his communication framework, believe me, but it helps to be given a language and framework for doing the work of listening and reflecting. </p>
<p>The final exercise in focussed attention mindfulness involved us each taking a piece of chocolate to fully experience mindfully. We took our time holding, touching, smelling and tasting the chocolate and observing our thoughts during the experience.</p>
<p>Aside from liking the chocolate and the discussion of the emotional and spiritual benefits of mindfulness meditation, I&rsquo;m really intrigued by the idea of using mindfulness practice to help in your work life. I&rsquo;ve dabbled in mindfulness meditation only briefly in my life, introduced to the idea when I was younger and interested in Thich Nhat Hanh&rsquo;s books. I was maybe too restless and unready at that time to meditate, even while walking or washing dishes, and have gravitated to more physical ways to connect mind and body. But I&rsquo;m finding that the possibilities have changed with everything as I&rsquo;ve matured. Sure it took me only a few decades to feel that, but better late than never. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense of connection in journaling when writing with your own hand that has the same feeling of connectedness I&rsquo;ve gotten in occasionally doing yoga in the past and in doing martial arts now. I like that hand writing feels more doable, but I feel like I need something like the structure of those prompts (the starter sentences above) to give me a framework for starting. Motivation is easy, but sustainable practice is hard. Quitting is easy. I like some of the ideas in Austin Kleon&rsquo;s <a href="http://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/">Show Your Work</a> for making yourself capture what you&rsquo;re working on daily. Google tells me a lot of people have come up with these <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=journaling+prompts">creative writing prompts for inspiration</a>, so I&rsquo;m also exploring that. </p>
<p>Here are some ideas Au suggested to apply when journaling.</p>
<ul><li>Collect list of prompts, randomly pick one daily</li><li>When a salient emotion occurs, write</li><li>Begin each day by tapping core values</li><li>Use as a &ldquo;brain dump&rdquo; and clarifier</li></ul>
<p>I suspect that I&rsquo;ll spend some time figuring out how to integrate what I took away from Irene&rsquo;s talk into my daily practice. </p>
