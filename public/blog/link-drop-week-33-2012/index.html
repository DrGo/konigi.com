"We have been, on a number of occasions, preparing for mass production and in a room and realised we are talking a little too loud about the virtues of something. That to me is always the danger, if I'm trying to talk a little too loud about something and realising I'm trying to convince myself that something's good.</li> <li><a href="http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/10-habits-of-remarkably-charismatic-people.html?nav=pop" class="ttl">10 Habits of Remarkably Charismatic People | Inc.com</a> </li> <li><a href="http://www.bestvendor.com/best/wireframing" class="ttl">The 10+ Best Wireframing Tools - BestVendor.com</a> There is no best tool, there's only what works for your situation and storyline.

I wonder how many would go with hiding options like Save As, using a key combination. There are some serious side effects to their hidden save as, by the way, as this post notes, resulting in the need to use the Revert To... feature, a technique also referred to as "unfucking." All of this only makes me think of people who use the term "unfuckingbelievable" in moments of crisis and disbelief.  It's never easy to remove from an interface, but at this level of use, it is is bold and not at all unbelievable.</li>
