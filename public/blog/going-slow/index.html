  <h2 class="post-title">Going Slow</h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/fashion/23slowblog.html"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/nytimes-slowblogging.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>The New York Times fashion section article, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/fashion/23slowblog.html">Blogging at a Snail&rsquo;s Pace</a>&rdquo; discusses slow blogging, a near Ludd-like movement against the practice of posting quick and in high volume. It&rsquo;s like slow food versus fast food. Slow bloggers discard the belief that webloggers need to post often, because the reflectiveness of thought and quality of writing suffer. When comparing the slow versus fast differences, <a href="http://bgblogging.wordpress.com/">Barbara Ganley</a>, a blogger who writes from Vermont had this to say.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ms. Ganley, the blogger in Vermont, has a slogan that encapsulates the trend: “Blog to reflect, Tweet to connect.” Blogging, she said, “is that slow place.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a distaste for fast blogging because I watch the fast blogs, and because I&rsquo;m somewhere in between, doing a little of both the fast and terse and the slow and thoughtful. I have found myself posting when there is time, and thinking about each entry as I deconstruct interfaces and visual designs. I once saw a tweet referencing Konigi that was surprised I didn&rsquo;t post more. It&rsquo;s because I try to post more thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Another interesting example from the article is <a href="http://dawdlr.tumblr.com/">dawdlr</a>, the rebel twin sister of Twitter. Dawdlr asks the same question essentially, &ldquo;what are you doing, you know, more generally?&rdquo; But the twist is you answer by postcard. </p>
<p><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/dawdlr.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></p>
<p>I love the idea of dawdler. Email, blogging, etc. has meant that I get and receive a lot fewer letters and postcards from friends and family. Close friends and family know I was passionate about letter writing, and tended to spend as much time crafting the actual letter and envelope as much as I did the writing and selection of the additional contents I&rsquo;d send along. There&rsquo;s something about the time in between replies that makes each letter that much denser and saturated in meaning.</p>
<p>My blogging arc has been somewhat wavy. I started blogging iaslash as a reblogger in 2001 and slowly started doing more and more critique and review there, and then retired from that blog in 2005. Over the course of my personal blog at urlgreyhot, I wrote lengthy essays, but essentially turned it into a microblogging site as I focussed on Konigi. Now, I do something in between the fast and slow. There&rsquo;s no high volume, and neither is there the multi-scroll essay. And I mix in some time to look at and tweak the tools I use in the real world. </p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m trying to be something more like the good, reliable neighborhood restaurant. I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m just happy you come to visit so I can serve you.</p></p>
