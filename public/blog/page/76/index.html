<p>Yes, clearly, that's what they must have been thinking about when they made that logo. <a href="http://logologos.blogspot.com/">Logólogos</a> proposes even more of the equations that describe popular logo design concepts.</p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/ok-cancel-or-cancel-ok/">OK-Cancel or Cancel-OK?</a></h2>
    <section class="article-body"><p>Jakob Nielsen's latest Alertbox recommends that <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/ok-cancel.html">order of OK vs Cancel</a> should be determined by the standard order defined by the platform's interface guidelines. Alas, if you're designing for the web, order becomes problematic because Windows interface guidelines put OK first, whereas Apple guidelines put it last. Nielsen suggests that you base the order on the installed platform of your audience, i.e. if you have predominantly Windows users, you might be best served by putting OK on the left.</p>
<p>The best part of this essay is that he provides persuasive arguments for either side, making it easy to see how user interface designers can pick a side and use the argument to justify a decision. But the main argument here is to use what your users are accustomed to, and when you can, write more meaningful labels than "OK" for your confirmation button. </p>
<p>As web designers we challenge the notion that how we do form interfaces needs to follow interface guidelines strictly. If we're smart, we stay aware of these guidelines and the Human Factors research that has gone into designing interface rules followed by traditional software designers. But, most of the time that we're dealing with buttons, we're not dealing with dialogs with only OK/Cancel buttons. Often we're designing lengthier forms. </p>
<p>So what happens if we look at our user statistics and decide that what our users are accustomed to sucks? We might feel justified to think about form design and how it applies to the web and go against the conventional rules for Windows and Apple interfaces. In the case of dealing with OK/Cancel buttons, for example, many interface designers opt to treat Cancel as a link rather than as a button. This way, we end up minimizing the Cancel button and encouraging the user to gravitate towards the submission button. </p>
<p>If you're interested in how to tackle forms for the web, Luke Wroblewski deals with issues like this and more in his excellent book <em><a href="http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/books/webforms/">Web Form Design: Filling in the blanks</a></em>.</p>

    <section class="article-body"><p>Lou Rosenfeld shares the <a href="http://louisrosenfeld.com/home/bloug_archive/2008/05/questions_for_iaim_vendors.html">questions one should pose</a> when engaging prospective consulting firms for information architecture and information management project work. This list of questions should be very valuable if you are on the customer end of a client-vendor relationship. </p>
<p>It also seems like it would be an interesting list of questions to think about if you're a consultant and have never been on the customer end. As a consultant, you probably already ask many of these questions of prospective clients as well, as part of your first client interview about a new project. If you're on that end, this gives an idea of the kinds of things to be prepared to answer. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.textflow.com/">TextFlow</a> is a new parallel document editing application and service that allows multiple users to work on a document simultaneously. The service should appeal to people who use the Track Changes feature of Microsoft Word. TextFlow lets users edit documents, and instantly see the changes suggested. One person can review the changes and apply them. </p>
<p>The difference between this service and something like Google Docs or working in a wiki, is that the changes are indicated visually, rather than having to go through the diff displays in revision history. It's simple and should be intuitive for users who use Track Changes in Word. </p>
<p>The service is currently in beta, and you can view a screencast demonstration on the TextFlow site.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.schmap.com/iphone/">iPhone service</a> attempts to maximize the unique features of that device.  Listings are simple lists with thumbnails, but if you rotate the phone to landscape orientation, the listings then display alongside a map with markers to show where each place is located. Rotating back returns to the list view. You can click on an item to view the detailed info. The info pages resemble address book entries in the iPhone. </p>
<p>Another different approach they&rsquo;ve taken to displaying list views can be found in their pagination. The lists contain a footer pinned to the bottom of the window. You can either use Prev/Next buttons to page through, or perform a 2-fingered scroll to move through the list in smaller increments. This seems like a different sort of interaction that I haven&rsquo;t experienced before. Scrolling in the iPhone can be a bit strange because of the lack of feedback about length of page that a scrollbar provides. This type of interface is trying to provide combined scrolling and pagination. </p>
<p>Schmap is different in that it isn&rsquo;t just tacking an IUI front end to its service. I&rsquo;ve tried their client application and their normal web site, and find that the iPhone application is quite a bit more pleasant to use and look at.</p></p>

wt4832e7e599724_0.jpg'/></a></div><p>Yet <a href="http://www.roku.com/netflixplayer/">another set top box makes a move to bring the 10 foot Internet TV and movie experience to your living room</a>. This time Roku, maker of the Soundbridge audio player, has teamed up with Netflix to deliver their video on demand service to a set top box designed for Netflix service only. The $100 box allows you to navigate your queue, view show/movie information, and stream videos that were previously only available for Internet streaming to Windows users previously. It&rsquo;s not apparent if you can browse videos outside of your queue. </p>
<p>For Netflix users, the service is included free of charge if your plan allows Internet streaming. The streaming catalog still only hovers around 10,000 movies compared to the 100,000 available DVDs.  This is mostly older titles, but that&rsquo;s still not a bad number and you can expect the catalog to grow. I can confirm that I see about 10% of my queue with Play Now options presently. Sadly, the box doesn&rsquo;t deliver HD, so expect VCR quality video.</p>
<p>This move brings Netflix further into the Internet-enabled set top box subcategory of the Video on Demand market   with manufacturers including Apple and VUDU. Look for cable set top boxes to incorporate more of these services over time, and with that, the introduction of yet more features into already crowded 10 foot menus.</p></p>

    <section class="article-body"><p>The stories of Zappos' commitment to superior customer service has become nearly legendary. From regular upgrades to next day delivery at no cost to the story of a customer service reps <a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/above-and-beyond/zappos-sends-you-flowers-311369.php">delivery of flowers</a> to a customer whos mother passed away. Now, in Harvard Business Online, Bill Taylor tells of Zappos' unusual customer training program. <a href="http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/taylor/2008/05/wy_zappos_pays_new_employees_t.html">Zappos offers new employees a $1000 offer to quit</a> after a 4 week training session. The idea behind this tactic is that by weeding out people who take the offer, they keep the ones who will be committed to the company.</p>
<blockquote><p>Because if you’re willing to take the company up on the offer, you obviously don’t have the sense of commitment they are looking for. It’s hard to describe the level of energy in the Zappos culture&#8212;which means, by definition, it’s not for everybody. Zappos wants to learn if there’s a bad fit between what makes the organization tick and what makes individual employees tick&#8212;and it’s willing to pay to learn sooner rather than later. (About ten percent of new call-center employees take the money and run.) </p>
<p>... </p>
<p>It’s a small practice with big implications: Companies don’t engage emotionally with their customers—people do. If you want to create a memorable company, you have to fill your company with memorable people.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that's innovative thinking&#8212;being willing to pay to find and keep committed employees.</p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/rise-contextual-user-interfaces/">The Rise of Contextual User Interfaces</a></h2>
    <section class="article-body"><p>In Alex Iskold's article, <a href="http://alexiskold.wordpress.com/2008/05/15/the-rise-of-contextual-user-interfaces/">The Rise of Contextual User Interfaces</a>, the writer and CEO of software company AdaptiveBlue talks about the rise of contextual interfaces on the desktop an in the services we use on the web.</p>
<p>He points out the failing of choice over context in the old paradigm of UI design. Standardization of UI elements (tabs, combo boxes, etc.) was meant as a way to keep users from having to learn how to use an interface. The argument made was apparently that users are stupid and this paradigm supported the idea that we shouldn't innovate on core UI elements because users wouldn't be able to figure out how to user our applications. But over time UI designers simply made all of the choices available in an application in the forefront, putting the burden of having to sift through all of them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another philosophy of the old UI approach was that the user wants to see all information all the time. Instead of building UIs that responded to the way that people actually interacted with the tool, the user interface opened up all possible choices at all times. Naturally, this is completely overwhelming and confusing to people.</p></blockquote>
<p>The result of the users are stupid/let's show all the choices paradigm ends up being, unfortunately, that even if users are smart enough to use these interfaces, they often end up feeling stupid when they can't figure out how to use bloated UIs. Sadly, many of these UIs make software so difficult to grok that we become frustrated using them, and often simply choose not use them.</p>
<p>The strategy of innovating interface elements based on usage and using simpler, contextual interfaces is the antithesis of the old paradigm, and is what is offered to rescue users from the flood of choices in lazily designed interfaces.</p>
<blockquote><p>The new interfaces are winning people over because they are based on usage patterns instead of choices. The key thing about new UIs is that they are contextual - presenting the user with minimal components and then changing in reaction to user gestures. Thanks to Apple, we have seen a liberating movement towards simplistic, contextual interfaces. </p></blockquote>
<p>Alex tells the story of something his boss once told him, declaring that user interface are cheap. What the boss meant was, that "the UI is so essential and so important to get right that you shouldn’t just reuse code and widgets."</p>
<p>Iskold points to Apple's ability to continually innovate on its interface, but points out that the use of contextual interfaces has increased on the web due to the use of the richer set of interactions provided by AJAX and RIA tools such as Flash. The example that many of us have commonly use are the controls provided by flash video sites when we hover over video players (e.g. in YouTube, Vimeo, etc.). These players hide the controls for viewing embedding options, related videos, etc. until you make the conscious decision to move the mouse over the video. Use of AJAX to make expert features available via expanding/collapsing and hiding/displaying design patterns are another example of contextual controls that can be provided nearby when needed.</p>
<p>Some of the innovations using contextual controls even break the traditional rules for how these controls work, but in the new model, this is done to provide emphasis to function over form. In the eyes of interface designers, the belief seems to be, "when an efficiency can be provided by breaking the rules, why not do it?"</p>
