    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/dear-brooklyn-its-not-you-its-me/">Dear Brooklyn, It&#39;s not you. It&#39;s me.</a></h2>
    <section class="article-body"><p><div class="screenshot"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/bk-mc.jpg" /></div>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending my final full week as a Brooklynite and feeling the bitter sweet pain of saying goodbye, while looking hopefully towards the next chapter of my life. After 19 years as a New Yorker, I&rsquo;m heading with my family to live in Marin County, CA. </p>
<p>New York is a city that I&rsquo;ve loved from childhood, and the only place I could see myself living as a young adult. With my head full of every cliché dream, I believed it was the place I needed to live to find myself. When I moved here I thought I would work in the art world, where I spent the first few years hustling, but I discovered my path was to lead elsewhere. I&rsquo;ve thrived in this inspiring city for a long time, and drew energy from this place. It&rsquo;s helped make me who I am today.</p>
<p>I spent a short time in the first few years living in Manhattan at Times Square and the East Village. The rest of my days were spent primarily in Brooklyn at Cobble Hill, Boerum Hill, Sunset Park, and in the last 9 years, Park Slope. If you know me, you know I&rsquo;ve considered myself a Brooklynite more than a New Yorker. There&rsquo;s an energy, creativity, diversity, and much more relaxed sense of being I&rsquo;ve found in Brooklyn that is wonderful. But nothing lasts, and although I thought I&rsquo;d live the rest of my days residing in Brooklyn, the pull to the outdoors became too strong. With 2 sons that need to bust out, break free from living in boxes, and restraining their boyish need to bounce and scream to be quiet for neighbors, the timing just feels right.</p>
<p>Many of the designers I&rsquo;ve come to know, respect and admire have been my neighbors here. This town introduced me to some incredibly smart people who have influenced me, from the original group of IAs that met in Victor Lombardi&rsquo;s IA Salon over 10 years ago, to the more recent impromptu gatherings Lou Rosenfeld, Yoni Knoll, and I have put together with our BK/UX peeps. I&rsquo;ve had a good run, and I&rsquo;ve met so many incredible people here who I hope to never lose as friends. I hope none of you hold it against me for leaving to the left coast, and I thank you for your friendship.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s with a little sadness that I say goodbye to New York, and with hopeful anticipation that I&rsquo;m welcomed to the Bay Area. If you&rsquo;re in San Francisco, know that I plan to spend a lot of time exploring in your beautiful city, and that I&rsquo;m always looking for like-minded UXers to have coffee with. I&rsquo;ve owed a few people a coffee date for years now. </p>
<p>See you on the other side.</p></p>

Every build and iteration requires review and circling back to evaluate the component in terms of the need identified in the use case scenario. Put into action, he says:<br />
How do we integrate the components back into a context for review? Ask the question: “What is the user trying to do here?” The job the user has in mind is the best integration point because the user’s mind doesn’t tidily follow the boundaries of implementation.</li>

The group meets frequently, literally sitting around a kitchen table, to debate all products under development. “We’ll sit there with our sketch books and trade ideas,” Stringer said, appearing as the first witness in the Apple vs. Samsung trial. “That’s where the really hard, brutal honest criticism comes in.”<br />
From there, the group puts the sketches into a computer-aided design program and, if warranted, creates a physical model. “Our role is to imagine products that don’t exist and guide them to life,” Stringer said. There could be 50 designs for a single button, he added. “We’re a pretty maniacal group of people,” he said.&rdquo;</li>

    <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/everything-in-its-right-pace/"><img id='bluga-thumbnail-2576' class='bluga-thumbnail large' src='http://media.konigi.com/bluga/
wt503901bbde9e1_large.jpg'/></a></div><p>Hannah Donovan&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/everything-in-its-right-pace/">essay in A List Apart</a> considers the issue of pace of delivery of information in web products. In a world where information is streamed constantly to us if we allow it, sometimes a slower pace, selective or scant data delivery, and better signal to noise is more appropriate and valuable. Context, medium, and place of use are important factors for determining delivery and pace.</p></p>

<p>I've been interested in the slow movement in recent years, as it relates to sustainable living, slow design, slow food, and the 1K Movement. In the summer of 2011, I was fortunate enough to experience a very special meal on a very small farm/restaurant in Italy's Le Marche region. All the food and drink prepared is grown on the farm or sourced hyper-locally, from meat and vegetables, to wine—everything within 1 kilometer. It was the most profound eating experience of my life. Little bits and pieces of that day have made me think about how my approach to work and life have become more and more connected to each other, and how much of an impact one's production and consumption decisions have on the world.</p>

<p>From a design and lifestyle perspective, I like to reference this summary of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Movement">philosophy of the Slow Movement</a> by Professor Guttorm Fløistad, found on Wikipedia:</p>

<p><blockquote>The only thing for certain is that everything changes. The rate of change increases. If you want to hang on you better speed up. That is the message of today. It could however be useful to remind everyone that <strong>our basic needs never change</strong>. The need to be seen and appreciated! It is the need to belong. The need for nearness and care, and for a little love! This is given only through slowness in human relations. In order to master changes, we have to recover slowness, reflection and togetherness. There we will find real renewal.</blockquote></p>

<p>It's a bit touchy-feely, and lives entirely in the center of Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs. But the idea of taking a holistic approach to fulfilling needs in all things, provides the basis for actually satisfying them in other ways up the triangle. Specifically, I'm thinking of the idea of fulfilling the needs for esteem and self-actualization as one example. In a scenario where speed and volume has become the norm, how has that situation impacted our lives?</p>

<p>I like how Donovan tells the story of learning from the experience at <a href="http://last.fm/">Last.fm</a> to imagine <a href="http://www.thisismyjam.com/">This is My Jam</a>, a product that goes the other way, and focuses on the quality and value of the experience, using pace as the point of pivot. I like this approach. I have mostly stopped consuming from the firehose, and seek out the products that deliver a signal that I get more value from, more satisfaction, or that fulfill my basic needs with less fluff and noise. The decision to work with a product and team that follows those ideals is important to me as well.</p>

<p>Beth Meredith and Eric Storm <a href="http://www.create-the-good-life.com/slow_design.html">summarize the concept of Slow Design</a>.</p>

<p><blockquote>Slow Design is a democratic and holistic design approach for creating appropriately tailored solutions for the long-term well being of people and the planet. To this end, Slow Design seeks out positive synergies between the elements in a system, celebrates diversity and regionalism, and cultivates meaningful relationships that add richness to life.</blockquote></p>

<p>The Slow Movement is not just a lifestyle choice, but as designers, we can choose to have an impact on the world based on these ideals.</p>

"We have been, on a number of occasions, preparing for mass production and in a room and realised we are talking a little too loud about the virtues of something.

All of this only makes me think of people who use the term "unfuckingbelievable" in moments of crisis and disbelief.

    <section class="article-body"><p><div class="video"><iframe width="610" height="343" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/I1UDS2kgqY8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>I got around to watching David Gelb&rsquo;s documentary, <a href="http://www.magpictures.com/jirodreamsofsushi/">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a> after seeing it making the rounds on the web repeatedly. I&rsquo;ve been on a documentary kick lately, and this has made it into the category of films I&rsquo;d re-watch. </p>
<p>The film looks at the life of celebrated sushi chef, Jiro Ono, whose small restaurant serves only sushi and requires a reservation 3 months in advance, and who is regarded as the most masterful sushi chef in Japan. After watching, I took a week to see what resonated with me, and there are a few topic that stick, related to the nurturing of one&rsquo;s craft. </p>
<p>The themes I latched onto focussed on the conversations about Jiro&rsquo;s craft. He holds steadfast to a strong work ethic, and the notion that perfection can only be achieved through years of rigor, experience, and apprenticeship. </p>
<p>The chef has focussed his life on serving sushi only. Apparently master chefs around the world agree that his minimalist approach and focus have lead to a remarkable depth of flavor that is hard to match. Food writer, Yamamoto, interviewed extensively for the film, sums his work up saying, &ldquo;Ultimate simplicity leads to purity.&rdquo; </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s valuable to notice in this story is the excruciating attention to detail and rigor, especially as told by Jiro&rsquo;s son and apprentice, Yoshikazu, who is to inherit his fathers restaurant. He talks about having talent (taste in this case), and says making a mark depends on how hard you work. </p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not trying to be exclusive or elite. The techniques we use are no big secret. It&rsquo;s just about making an effort and repeating the same thing every day.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think in a way, he is selling himself short when he talks about talent, because I get the feeling he is talking about his father, not himself. But there is something in the depth of knowledge that Yoshikazu has acquired that interests me. It&rsquo;s shown in a much simpler manner, as if he is the worker/doer behind the master, but to me this story steals the spotlight. In doing the work, he is completely subservient to and obedient to the discipline and to his teacher. Everything is taken seriously, and rules are stubbornly adhered to. </p>
<p>I like this idea of the acquisition of skill in the pursuit of being perfect, but there&rsquo;s a sense of sadness, doubt, and feeling of inadequacy in Yoshikazu, until the punchline at the end. There are interesting and at times sad stories of parenting or lack of it, cultural and familial responsibility, and the struggle and drive that comes out of necessity and need to survive. Throughout the telling of this story, it felt like the hyper focus and obsession cost dearly in other ways. </p>
<p>I think if anything, I feel humbled by the obsession with craft told in the story. I don&rsquo;t feel compelled to be as extreme in my own pursuit of craft, at the cost of balance and life, but there is something positive in the message about showing up and doing the work that is told so much more completely here than in any clever and terse poster. Definitely worth the watch. </p>

The first meaning: if you’ve conceived something in your mind, decide to do it, and are willing to put in the work – nothing can stop you. The second is fairly self-explanatory but carries the extra weight of it coming from the guy who invented the very thing that’s letting me type these words out on the internet.</li>
