      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;notebook-screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/everything-in-its-right-pace/&#34;&gt;&lt;img id=&#39;bluga-thumbnail-2576&#39; class=&#39;bluga-thumbnail large&#39; src=&#39;http://media.konigi.com/bluga/
wt503901bbde9e1_large.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah Donovan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/everything-in-its-right-pace/&#34;&gt;essay in A List Apart&lt;/a&gt; considers the issue of pace of delivery of information in web products. In a world where information is streamed constantly to us if we allow it, sometimes a slower pace, selective or scant data delivery, and better signal to noise is more appropriate and valuable. Context, medium, and place of use are important factors for determining delivery and pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been interested in the slow movement in recent years, as it relates to sustainable living, slow design, slow food, and the 1K Movement. In the summer of 2011, I was fortunate enough to experience a very special meal on a very small farm/restaurant in Italy&#39;s Le Marche region. All the food and drink prepared is grown on the farm or sourced hyper-locally, from meat and vegetables, to wine—everything within 1 kilometer. It was the most profound eating experience of my life. Little bits and pieces of that day have made me think about how my approach to work and life have become more and more connected to each other, and how much of an impact one&#39;s production and consumption decisions have on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a design and lifestyle perspective, I like to reference this summary of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Movement&#34;&gt;philosophy of the Slow Movement&lt;/a&gt; by Professor Guttorm Fløistad, found on Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The only thing for certain is that everything changes. The rate of change increases. If you want to hang on you better speed up. That is the message of today. It could however be useful to remind everyone that &lt;strong&gt;our basic needs never change&lt;/strong&gt;. The need to be seen and appreciated! It is the need to belong. The need for nearness and care, and for a little love! This is given only through slowness in human relations. In order to master changes, we have to recover slowness, reflection and togetherness. There we will find real renewal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a bit touchy-feely, and lives entirely in the center of Maslow&#39;s Heirarchy of Needs. But the idea of taking a holistic approach to fulfilling needs in all things, provides the basis for actually satisfying them in other ways up the triangle. Specifically, I&#39;m thinking of the idea of fulfilling the needs for esteem and self-actualization as one example. In a scenario where speed and volume has become the norm, how has that situation impacted our lives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like how Donovan tells the story of learning from the experience at &lt;a href=&#34;http://last.fm/&#34;&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt; to imagine &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thisismyjam.com/&#34;&gt;This is My Jam&lt;/a&gt;, a product that goes the other way, and focuses on the quality and value of the experience, using pace as the point of pivot. I like this approach. I have mostly stopped consuming from the firehose, and seek out the products that deliver a signal that I get more value from, more satisfaction, or that fulfill my basic needs with less fluff and noise. The decision to work with a product and team that follows those ideals is important to me as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beth Meredith and Eric Storm &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.create-the-good-life.com/slow_design.html&#34;&gt;summarize the concept of Slow Design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Slow Design is a democratic and holistic design approach for creating appropriately tailored solutions for the long-term well being of people and the planet. To this end, Slow Design seeks out positive synergies between the elements in a system, celebrates diversity and regionalism, and cultivates meaningful relationships that add richness to life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Slow Movement is not just a lifestyle choice, but as designers, we can choose to have an impact on the world based on these ideals.&lt;/p&gt;

wt4d3d7d006cc4f_large.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just started reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whatmakesthemclick.net/&#34;&gt;What Makes Them Click&lt;/a&gt;, Susan Weinschenk&amp;rsquo;s blog for people who want to learn how to apply psychology to understand how people think, work, and relate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The blog focuses especially on applying the latest research in psychology to make you more effective, be more successful at your work and in your career, and get to know better why you and the people around you do what you do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susan wrote the New Rider&#39;s book, &lt;em&gt;Neuro Web Design: What makes them click&lt;/em&gt;, which applies the latest research on unconscious mental processing and persuasion principles to the design of web sites. Read more at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whatmakesthemclick.net/&#34;&gt;What Makes Them Click&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Just add an egg: Usability, User Experience and Dramaturgy</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/just-add-egg-usability-user-experience-and-dramaturgy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;notebook-screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.90percentofeverything.com/2009/10/20/just-add-an-egg-usability-user-experience-and-dramaturgy/&#34;&gt;&lt;img id=&#39;bluga-thumbnail-1916&#39; class=&#39;bluga-thumbnail large&#39; src=&#39;http://media.konigi.com/bluga/
wt4addf12b507b3.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry Brignull quotes a passage from Susan Marks&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Finding Betty Crocker&lt;/em&gt; to tell the story of how the cake mix maker used a clever bit of imagination about the process of using their product to give customers the feeling of playing a desirable role&amp;ndash;that of home-maker and cook. They did this by simply requiring that real eggs be used in making cakes, rather than incorporating powered egg, and marketed this as a benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brignull sums up the use of psychology in the creation of this story and sense of role as a clever manipulation of the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[P]sychologists realized the customer wanted to play the role of a successful home-maker and cook. We could even go so far to argue that their customers may have felt societal pressures to perform this role well. The egg, therefore, becomes more than an ingredient, and more than just an extra pleasurable step. It becomes a prop, enabling the customer to play a social role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brignull points out that we can make that comparison to usability and efficiency vs. the creation of emotional contact and the feeling of satisfaction. The egg stands in place of some role that enables some aspect of the fulfilling experience. Looking at the experience from this perspective has so much to do with understanding the customer, and what they want to get out of making cakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;dek&#34;&gt;Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies on TED: freedom of choice. In Schwartz&amp;rsquo;s estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more dissatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that more choice leads to paralysis rather than happiness resonates strongly with me. I think about where I am in terms of my spiritual and psychological development, and I do feel dissatisfied when things aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect today and I find it troublesome that I think this way. But I do remember where choices of some things were limited, although that period may have been very short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Westerner, I think the number of choices put in front of me for any particular consumer item has been overwhelmingly many. Schwartz says this abundance causes many of us to have difficulty making decisions. We become paralyzed. And even when we&amp;rsquo;re able to overcome the paralysis, we end up feeling less satisfied. The more options there are, the easier it is to regret choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is terribly sad, but it is a reality we deal with as interface designers as well. As someone who is working on an incredibly complex piece of software&amp;#8212;so complex that I struggle to understand some of the more powerful, yet obscure features&amp;#8212;the challenge is enormous. If people experience this flood of choice and paralysis in their everyday experience, you can damn well be sure that they&amp;rsquo;re not going to tolerate it when they have to use your software to get their job done. Or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll tolerate it and be pissed off all the time about it. So you&amp;rsquo;d better work extra hard not to piss them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this comes down to making decisions for people. If you have to have the obscure, less utilized feature, the challenge is to find a way to enable its use without creating a cognitive cost in what you present for the primary use cases. We utilize progressive disclosure for some of these things. It&amp;rsquo;s hard work making decisions to make things less prominent or to cut features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about this great screenshot of the Zune from Giles Colborne&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/cxpartners/secrets-of-simplicity&#34;&gt;Secrets of Simplicity&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; presentation. When the Zune removed features it got better reviews. That may only be perceived improvement, but it most likely also reflects better decision making around what&amp;rsquo;s necessary rather than about keeping ahead of pace with the market in terms of growing features, something that Microsoft software is notorious for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://media.konigi.com/notebook/zune-simplicity.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:310px !important;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s the job we have to do as UX designers arguing on behalf of the silent user. I think of this like being the lawyer representing a body of plaintiffs that&amp;rsquo;s suffered damaged due to neglect. Some software companies can defend the position that they&amp;rsquo;ve made decisions based on what they thought people wanted (more choice) and get away with that. The other aspect of choice is that people can also decide to stop patronizing you and buying your software. The smart companies take notice, become accountable, and invest in making things right even if its at a cost in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This the mentality we have to take, and the arguments we have to make when looking at the glut of decisions we present users with. We need to be accountable to those who pay us to use our products. The flip side of choice is this. More is not always better. Less is not exactly more. Best is providing the right options at the right time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Realizations of Rounded Rectangles</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/realizations-rounded-rectangles/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/realizations-rounded-rectangles/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;notebook-screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uiandus.com/2009/07/27/theories/realizations-of-rounded-rectangles/&#34;&gt;&lt;img id=&#39;bluga-thumbnail-1845&#39; class=&#39;bluga-thumbnail large&#39; src=&#39;http://media.konigi.com/bluga/
wt4a76fe347eb48.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plasq designer, Keith Lang, recounts the story from computer folklore of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uiandus.com/2009/07/27/theories/realizations-of-rounded-rectangles/&#34;&gt;how the rounded rectangle came to dominate&lt;/a&gt; the Mac OS, and discusses its effect on visual cognition. He gets Professor Jürg Nänni, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blelb.com/english/blelbpub/publications_en.htm&#34;&gt;Visual Perception&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to offer his opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rectangle with sharp edges takes indeed a little bit more cognitive visible effort than for example an ellipse of the same size. Our “fovea-eye” is even faster in recording a circle. Edges involve additional neuronal image tools. The process is therefore slowed down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Nänni is saying that rounded rectangles are literally easier on the eye. Put another way, compared to square-edged rectangles, rounded rectangles are more computationally efficient for the human brain. To me, this is a revelation. An idea that at the very least demands more investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comment by Voideka provides a perfect visual reading of the difference between the rounded and sharp angled shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;to me the difference I perceive is a single line versus four lines. In other words, when corners are involved, the brain processes from point A to B, then B to C, and so on, until it completes a circuit. With rounded corners, the line never comes to a point, which we interpret as a stop, and so there is a single computation following the entire shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the key is in thinking of a point as a full stop (much like a period in a sentence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point being made is that a particular use of shape, color, position, and movement are not simply aesthetic decisions, but can impact visual cognition. Mullet Sano&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0133033899&#34;&gt;Designing Visual Interfaces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is another good source for the kinds of principles that can be used in practice. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read Nänni&amp;rsquo;s book, but have read a lot of literature on visual literacy, and tend to like the argument, however subtle, about the impact of the rounded shape on effort and perception.&lt;/p&gt;
