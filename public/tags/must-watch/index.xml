      <title>Kathy Sierra on Creating Awesome Users</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;video&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://player.vimeo.com/video/96807822?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;dek&#34;&gt;The model for sustaining customer loyalty is reverse engineering user awesomeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peldi pointed me to a video of &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.businessofsoftware.org/2010/05/kathy-sierra-at-business-of-software-2009.html&#34;&gt;Kathy Sierra&amp;rsquo;s presentation at Business of Software 09&lt;/a&gt;, where she talks about sustaining passionate and loyal customers. Positioning and generating sustainable relationships is not what you think it should be about. It&amp;rsquo;s about user benefits, and not features&amp;ndash;about how they feel about themselves in the context of what you provide them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t make a better [X], make a better [user of X].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What creates the conditions for a user to be happy is how they experience what they do in the world because of what you give them. To jump to the chase, it&amp;rsquo;s not about good products, good service, or good companies. It&amp;rsquo;s not about you at all. It&amp;rsquo;s about your users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model for sustaining customer loyalty is reverse engineering user awesomeness. Doing things that continue to let them say, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m awesome&amp;rdquo; because of things your product lets them do. Helping people kick ass FTW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t sell me, teach me and I&amp;rsquo;ll do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example she gives has to do with how you treat examples vs. documentation. She references a Nikon learning site that shows people how to capture a waterfall, and cuts right to that user voice that says, &amp;ldquo;I want to do that.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing a learning experience that tells this story rather than expecting users to read the manual, the user can do more and go further than any technical document will ever enable them to do. Manuals let users understand tools, but stories and examples help users have great experiences. If you help users have that experience, they associate you with that experience&amp;ndash;that awesomeness they create themselves. It&amp;rsquo;s not about creating better products necessarily, it&amp;rsquo;s about enabling people to become better users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She suggests focussing on compelling questions, like the ones below, that have to do with creating that user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on what the user does, not what you do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask, &amp;ldquo;What does having a solution mean to our users? What [bigger cooler thing] is enabled?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give them super powers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer better gear and help them justify it to others. Give them higher &amp;ldquo;resolution&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivate and Inspire. Give them motivation for things they WANT to do but aren&amp;rsquo;t. Get stuck camera users out of P mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the right thing easy and the wrong thing difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make them actually smarter. Keep users working on the smart things. Offer exercises, games, etc. that support deliberate practice of the right things. Make the time more fun. Turn the brain on with cognitive pleasures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shrink the user&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)&#34;&gt;10,000 hours&lt;/a&gt; (time spent working on a specific task), by giving them patterns or shortening the duration of that time. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your product or your documentation reflect how they really feel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does being your user SAY about your user? What would their tshirt read?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the heroes journey, we have to think about who we are to our users, and what role we actually play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t insist on inclusivity. It&amp;rsquo;s OK to split off the advanced ass kickers from the newbies in your community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to agree with the closing point she makes. What we&amp;rsquo;re doing by making software is increasing the resolution of the universe for people&amp;ndash;increasing their ability to see more and feel expert in their world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.businessofsoftware.org/2010/05/kathy-sierra-at-business-of-software-2009.html&#34;&gt;watched the hour long video above&lt;/a&gt;, I highly recommend making the time to come back to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Michael Bierut: 5 Secrets from 86 Notebooks</title>

&lt;p&gt;This is fantastic presentation from Pentagram&amp;rsquo;s Michael Bierut at The 99 Percent conference. Shows how a quiet, humble, and empathetic bedside manner can be such useful attributes in a designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renowned graphic designer Michael Bierut claims that he&amp;rsquo;s not creative. Instead, he likens his job to that of a doctor who tends to patients  – &amp;ldquo;the sicker, the better.&amp;rdquo; Digging into the 86 notebooks he&amp;rsquo;s kept over the course of his career, Bierut walks us through 5 projects – from original conception to final execution – extracting a handful of simple lessons (e.g. the problem contains the solution; don&amp;rsquo;t avoid the obvious) at the foundation of brilliant design solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Barry Schwartz on the Paradox of Choice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;video&#34;&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;dek&#34;&gt;Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies on TED: freedom of choice. In Schwartz&amp;rsquo;s estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more dissatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that more choice leads to paralysis rather than happiness resonates strongly with me. I think about where I am in terms of my spiritual and psychological development, and I do feel dissatisfied when things aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect today and I find it troublesome that I think this way. But I do remember where choices of some things were limited, although that period may have been very short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Westerner, I think the number of choices put in front of me for any particular consumer item has been overwhelmingly many. Schwartz says this abundance causes many of us to have difficulty making decisions. We become paralyzed. And even when we&amp;rsquo;re able to overcome the paralysis, we end up feeling less satisfied. The more options there are, the easier it is to regret choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is terribly sad, but it is a reality we deal with as interface designers as well. As someone who is working on an incredibly complex piece of software&amp;#8212;so complex that I struggle to understand some of the more powerful, yet obscure features&amp;#8212;the challenge is enormous. If people experience this flood of choice and paralysis in their everyday experience, you can damn well be sure that they&amp;rsquo;re not going to tolerate it when they have to use your software to get their job done. Or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll tolerate it and be pissed off all the time about it. So you&amp;rsquo;d better work extra hard not to piss them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this comes down to making decisions for people. If you have to have the obscure, less utilized feature, the challenge is to find a way to enable its use without creating a cognitive cost in what you present for the primary use cases. We utilize progressive disclosure for some of these things. It&amp;rsquo;s hard work making decisions to make things less prominent or to cut features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about this great screenshot of the Zune from Giles Colborne&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/cxpartners/secrets-of-simplicity&#34;&gt;Secrets of Simplicity&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; presentation. When the Zune removed features it got better reviews. That may only be perceived improvement, but it most likely also reflects better decision making around what&amp;rsquo;s necessary rather than about keeping ahead of pace with the market in terms of growing features, something that Microsoft software is notorious for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://media.konigi.com/notebook/zune-simplicity.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:310px !important;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s the job we have to do as UX designers arguing on behalf of the silent user. I think of this like being the lawyer representing a body of plaintiffs that&amp;rsquo;s suffered damaged due to neglect. Some software companies can defend the position that they&amp;rsquo;ve made decisions based on what they thought people wanted (more choice) and get away with that. The other aspect of choice is that people can also decide to stop patronizing you and buying your software. The smart companies take notice, become accountable, and invest in making things right even if its at a cost in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This the mentality we have to take, and the arguments we have to make when looking at the glut of decisions we present users with. We need to be accountable to those who pay us to use our products. The flip side of choice is this. More is not always better. Less is not exactly more. Best is providing the right options at the right time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So you&#39;re thinking about becoming a designer?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/so-youre-thinking-about-becoming-designer/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/so-youre-thinking-about-becoming-designer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Liz Danzico sought out the advice of digital designers and designer conspirers to ask them to respond to the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’re thinking about becoming a designer? If I could tell you only one thing about going into the field, my advice would be ___________ .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggestions ranged from the philosophical to the pragmatic. Below are the ones that resounded with me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Focus on empathy and understanding problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;martop1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Being empathetic helps designers create things that move people.&lt;br /&gt;
- Jennifer Bove&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t just fall in love with a solution and go full force and making it look great, but really make sure that whatever you design is filling a need in the world and has a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;
- Whitney Hess
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to design, I&#39;m a big believer in empathy, as are most IA/IXD&#39;s who invest in user research. Jennifer Bove&#39;s video focusses on this. Whitney Hess also hits on a similar point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video&#34;&gt;
&lt;object width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;300&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5802242&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5802242&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;300&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to finding solutions for people, I&#39;m also a fan of JM Spool&#39;s &#34;don&#39;t do anything stupid, don&#39;t do anything clever,&#34; although it&#39;s more about finding the middle ground between clever and stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Embrace the unfamiliar to innovate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;martop1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be a champion of effortful study, the act of constantly tackling problems and challenges that lie at the very edge of your ability.&lt;br /&gt;
- Ryan Sims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also a big fan of taking on new work that is unfamiliar in order to be &lt;a href=&#34;tags/innovation.html&#34;&gt;innovative&lt;/a&gt; and improve one&#39;s skills. I love what Bill Buxton and Paula  Scher have to say on this topic. Ryan Sims, also states it rather succinctly and points out that there will be dues to pay if you want the experience and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video&#34;&gt;
&lt;object width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;300&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5802338&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5802338&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;300&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be passionate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;martop1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have undying, unending passion for what it is you&#39;re doing. You&#39;ll run up against people who don&#39;t understand, who don&#39;t want to pay for it, who don&#39;t respect it. Ultimately none of that matters if you have the passion to make that happen.&lt;br /&gt;
- John Kolko&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I think the thing that I agree with most, whether it has to do with design or knitting or whatever you do, is that you have to be passionate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video&#34;&gt;
&lt;object width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;307&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5802291&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5802291&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;307&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t believe that passion is important, or that you can&#39;t get you far without &lt;em&gt;talent&lt;/em&gt;, I suggest watching &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0878134/&#34;&gt;A Man Named Pearl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the documentary about a self-taught topiary artist who, prompted by a bigoted comment,  proves to everyone around him that hard work and passion are what matter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inside IDEO</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/inside-ideo/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/inside-ideo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design Observer &lt;a href=&#34;http://designobserver.com/archives/observed.html?id=47147&#34;&gt;points to&lt;/a&gt; the 1999 ABC Nightline program that took an inside look at IDEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the process of designing a better product work? To show you, Nightline went to Palo Alto, CA to the designers at IDEO, and gave them the toughest problem we could think of. Take something old and familiar like the shopping cart and completely redesign it in just five days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDEO&amp;rsquo;s unique brand of brainstorming is called &amp;ldquo;Deep Dive,&amp;rdquo; a sort of total immersion into the problem at hand. It&amp;rsquo;s one company&amp;rsquo;s secret weapon for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great quote in video 2 that I took away with me. &amp;ldquo;Enlightened trial and error succeeds over the plans of the lone genius.&amp;rdquo; This was a reaction to the question about why a team vote on brainstorming trumps a boss&amp;rsquo;s opinion. There&amp;rsquo;s also the adage, &amp;ldquo;Fail Often To Succeed Sooner&amp;rdquo; that&amp;rsquo;s often referenced at IDEO, regarding their prototyping process. It&amp;rsquo;s great to see the process of ideation, refinement, organization and focusing, and prototyping in this video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/2Dtrkrz0yoU&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantastic TED video of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/paula_scher_gets_serious.html&#34;&gt;Paula Scher looking back at her career&lt;/a&gt; for those moments where she was able to devote time and effort to serious play and create wonderful work, and contrasting it with the unfortunate moments when the serious becomes solemn. I love how this retrospective observation of her career brings her to conclude that the best of times for her as a designer is when she comes into a project with no grounding or bearing&amp;ndash;those times where lack of history or reference point allows that kind of play to emerge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bill Buxton Lecture on Sketching and Experience Design at Stanford</title>

      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;dek&#34;&gt;Bill Buxton gives a lecture at the Stanford University Human-Computer Interaction Seminar (CS 547, June 1, 2007) giving an excellent deep dive into some of the topics in his book, &lt;em&gt;Sketching User Experiences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video&#34;&gt;
&lt;object width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;344&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/xx1WveKV7aE&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/xx1WveKV7aE&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;344&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designing for experience comes with a whole new level of complexity. This is especially true in this emerging world of information appliances, reactive environments, and ubiquitous computing, where, along with those of their users, we have to factor in the convoluted behaviors of the products themselves. In this talk, Bill discusses the design process itself, from the perspective of methods, organization, and composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His discussion of the necessity of sketching and ideation in the design process ultimately describes what design is about. While engineering might be about getting the design right, design is about getting the right design. To arrive at the right design, we have to be willing to produce many ideas, to present and argue them, and to want to be wrong so that we can learn and improve on what comes out of the design critique.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clover Innovates the Coffee Maker</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The $11,000 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cloverequipment.com/home/&#34;&gt;Clover Coffee Maker&lt;/a&gt; brews one cup of coffee at a time using a method similar to a French Press, but with the ability to customize water volume and temperature per cup. The machine is programmable and has a network connection, so the machine can use brewing parameters for specific roasts. Check the video below for the Clover in action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video&#34;&gt;
&lt;object width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;344&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/zAEagZRoXPY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/zAEagZRoXPY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;344&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Wired Magazine, Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks described the coffee by saying, &#34;In my 25 years at Starbucks, the Clover machine unquestionably delivers the best cup of brewed coffee I have ever tasted.&#34; Schultz tried his first cup after seeing a line formed outside of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cafegrumpy.com/&#34;&gt;Cafe Grumpy&lt;/a&gt; in Chelsea. The company later bought out the Coffee Equipment Company, which makes the Clover, and will be testing them in Starbucks coffee shops. Shultz, who has retaken the position of CEO is hoping to restore the original idea of Starbucks, and support the the heritage of coffee at their shops. They will be making changes like grinding beans in store, and getting rid of the breakfast sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clover seems to have an almost cult-like following. What I like most about this story is the history and back story of the Coffee Equipment Company. The company was started by Zander Nosler, a former product designer at IDEO, with the purpose of perfecting the single-brew coffee machine, based on research he did designing a commercial machine while at IDEO. This single idea led to the realization of a machine that produced unmatched quality in a cup of coffee that no other machine had, by focusing on delivering one cup at a time with very controlled customization of the brewing process. That attention to this process produced this $11,000 machine that indie shops and wealthy coffee connoisseurs were apparently happily paying for to make the perfect cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clover is no longer for sale to indie shops and individuals. It will be manufactured for Starbucks only in the future. For more about the Clover Coffee Machine, check out the August issue of Wired. &lt;/p&gt;
