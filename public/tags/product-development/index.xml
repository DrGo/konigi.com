      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devil runs UX workshops for idle hands, and he comes up with bad features. This is Des Traynor&amp;rsquo;s lightning talk at Business of Software in 2013. He did an extended version of this in 2014, but the pecha kucha version gets to the heart of the topic. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>99u Conference Notes: Quirky Studio Visit with Ben Kaufman</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/99u-conference-notes-quirky-studio-visit-ben-kaufman/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/99u-conference-notes-quirky-studio-visit-ben-kaufman/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A group of &lt;a href=&#34;http://conference.99u.com/&#34;&gt;99u attendees&lt;/a&gt; had a visit with Ben Kaufman, the CEO/founder of product development company &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quirky.com/&#34;&gt;Quirky&lt;/a&gt;, who gave us a look into how his company uses crowd-sourcing to deliver products. Here are some of my notes from that visit. More 99u notes to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaufman got his start as an inventor in high school when he made a lanyard to hold an iPod shuffle. The company he started to ship this product later morphed into Mophie, the maker of the JuiceBox battery case. He later sold that company to start Quirky. His wanted to take all of the pain and learning he went through designing, developing and shipping a product to the masses, so that anyone with a great idea could become an inventor and let someone else handle the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their mission is to &amp;quot;Make invention accessible.&amp;quot; What they do beyond helping people see if their ideas are unique and viable, is provide an infrastructure and experts for the entire process of design, development, marketing, and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaufman began his talk with a story comparing the Empire State Building, which took 410 days to complete, with a potato peeler that took 3 years to complete. His point is that having more time to deliver a product doesn&#39;t always lead to better quality. Quirky works in 11 week sprints, and ships 3 new crowd-sourced products every week. To further make his point, he talked about the difference between invention vs. tweaking, and had us look back 100 years ago to the Model T, which gave us a 17mpg automobile in 1909. Fast forward to 2009, and the most popular truck, a Ford, is giving us 16 MPG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quirky makes it possible for anyone to submit ideas. They&#39;re known for helping a teenager bring Pivot Power, a flexing power strip, to the world and making the inventor over a million dollars. Now their intellectual property partnership with GE has allowed them to bring someone&#39;s idea about making air conditioners smarter to save the world&#39;s energy into a reality too. He gave us a look at how the company and their extensive community selects products for manufacturing using weekly community meetings, their web site to manage the decision-making and evolution of ideas. They have an open community-driven selection process. Somehow the Hollywood pitch in my mind is product development shop meets American Idol. They even use a bit of game mechanics to drive product name selection. The profits are shared among everyone who participates in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their founder&#39;s passion and company culture feel genuine. They believe in their people, and in no-bullshit core values. I can&#39;t recall what all of their 5 core values were, but among them were impatience, agility, and getting shit done. They actually use those for evaluation. It was great to get a peek into how they take ideas that we&#39;re familiar with in software development, and push them to the limit in manufacturing. They change the status quo and what&#39;s the most interesting part is not so much their output (and their fantastic prototyping facility), but how they&#39;re running a business with so many projects constantly running and so many products shipping given the real world obstacles in manufacturing, which accounts for the slow pace at which the world usually delivers products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 11 week sprints, they have 3 blackout periods where they close the offices entirely and no one works. No one even answers the phones. They have a big office party the night before every blackout starts (blackout before the blackout I guess). They don&#39;t have set vacation day policies, but everyone is expected to take 3-4 weeks of time off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize constraints and speed to push product quality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rely on the wisdom of community&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Believe and value your people—passion is intrinsic to culture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your app is a collection of tiny details</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/your-app-collection-tiny-details/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/your-app-collection-tiny-details/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;dek&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;t14&#34;&gt;&#34;Getting the details right is the difference between something that delights, and something customers tolerate.&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;Jeff Atwood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/this-is-all-your-app-is-a-collection-of-tiny-details.html&#34;&gt;Jeff Atwood&#39;s article about cat feeders&lt;/a&gt; right away, because it really is 90% about a cat product. It&#39;s also a terrific demonstration of what he&#39;s saying above. The first version of the product, a cat feeder, served a core need well enough for him to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing&#34;&gt;satisfice&lt;/a&gt; with its shortcomings because the net return in time savings and improved quality of life, for him anyway, was absolutely worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The punchline is this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure you&#39;re first getting the primary function more or less right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the work of listening to users every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refine the details of your product based on their feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to the opinions expressed by customers, obsessing over the details, and getting them right in the design is necessary and hard. But over time, if the points of pain are incrementally addressed and the design improved, the collection of those well-thought-out details embody a better experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get better slowly, but &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get better. Suck it up and feel your users&#39; pain. Assure them that you&#39;re listening by sweating the details. &lt;/p&gt;
    

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/this-is-all-your-app-is-a-collection-of-tiny-details.html&#34;&gt;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/this-is-all-your-app-is-a-collection-of-tiny-details.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Letting Go</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/letting-go/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two great slides from Yiibu&#39;s presentation, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/yiibu/letting-go-9109114&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;Letting Go&lt;/a&gt;, a talk about design in an time of increasing disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6170/6188891324_71eb68e152_z.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;Issuing your customers with something that is rough, incomplete, and possibly even substandard seems counterintuitive but there is growing evidence that people don&#39;t necessarily want the perfect product. They prefer to deal with something ragged around the edges that they can adapt or improve.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;  Martin Thomas in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Loose-Future-Business-Letting-Go/dp/0755361555&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&#34;Loose: The Future of Business is Letting Go&#34;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;The best designs will set the stage, but stop short of fully defining the experience.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Articulating Your Preferred Use Case</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/articulating-your-preferred-use-case/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/articulating-your-preferred-use-case/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like how Seth Godin states everything so clearly. Usually it&#39;s a pithy piece of advice about how to do the right thing, do right by your product, and thereby do right for the market by serving the right users with the product they want, and forgetting about trying to serve everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s one thought about really knowing your use case and putting it out front for the market to see, and letting it guide your conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Many organizations will take any customer, any time, and bend and writhe to accomodate money in whatever form it arrives. Other, happier organizations understand the benefit of optimizing for a certain kind of interaction, and they have the guts to decline the part of the market that doesn&#39;t want to use their tool/organization the way it was intended.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what to do if your use case becomes irrelevant (ouch!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;You&#39;ll often be wrong about what the market is and what it wants. When that happens, time to either shift your use case (and the way you&#39;re organized around it) or stick it out but be prepared for a long, tough slog.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear, hear. More &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/07/articulating-your-preferred-use-case.html&#34;&gt;over here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Being Without Chasing: The Grateful Dead vs. The Top 40</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/being-without-chasing-grateful-dead-vs-top-40/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/being-without-chasing-grateful-dead-vs-top-40/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seth Godin&#39;s blog entry, &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/06/the-grateful-dead-and-the-top-40.html&#34;&gt;The Grateful Dead and the Top 40&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; looks at a band that only ever had 1 &amp;quot;hit record,&amp;quot; but who were very succesful at what they did. They may have not hit the Top 40 more than once, but one thing is true, they knew themselves as artists, and were true to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of chart success, Elton John is probably the polar opposite of The Grateful Dead. He&#39;s #2 on the list of most hits on the Billboard Top 40. The Grateful Dead and Elton John are very different artists and have sold records to very different audiences. Elton John has a bigger share of the mainstream and the Billboard charts. I would doubt that either of those attributes were ever a goal of the Grateful Dead, yet they commanded a loyal following who connected with them, and got their music to millions of fans through record sales, touring, and the bootlegs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not a fan, but so many of my friends in college were that I couldn&#39;t help but be aware of the phenomenon that is the Dead. Yet to the mainstream pop music listener, they may seem like small potatoes, and I&#39;ve heard a few people in my time dismiss their music without acknowledging the rarity of their following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dismissive criticism was probably a much easier thing to avoid before the Internet. Godin points out that social media today makes it easy to notice the passing mutterings of the critics who aren&#39;t clued in to what makes you special in the market. To those finding themselves receiving this kind of attention and wanting to be reactive in order to reach Elton-status, he offers this advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The next time you have a choice between chasing the charts (whichever charts you keep track of) and doing the work your customers crave, do the work instead.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing important work on a product that isn&#39;t on the charts might be tough. You might be doing work that goes unseen compared to products that are easily noticeable and press-worthy. Every product is going to find a critic. If you&#39;re making a product, being Elton-famous shouldn&#39;t be your goal. Knowing yourself and your product, and being true to that are better ways of doing something meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Via Seth&#39;s Blog: &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/06/the-grateful-dead-and-the-top-40.html&#34;&gt;The Grateful Dead and the Top 40.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Steve Jobs on Saying No</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/steve-jobs-saying-no/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/steve-jobs-saying-no/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;dek&#34;&gt;“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on.  But that’s not what it means at all.  It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.  I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done.  Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;Steve Jobs on product development, from &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.forbes.com/carminegallo/2011/05/16/steve-jobs-get-rid-of-the-crappy-stuff/&#34;&gt;Steve Jobs: Get Rid of the Crappy Stuff&lt;/a&gt;&#34; in Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallo exaggerates a little, but I like the point he tries to argue later in the article about focus and reduction. It takes courage to reduce and say no, and that is a big differentiator when it comes to Apple hardware and software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is the easy example, but for good reason. Many argue that hindsight analysis of Jobs&#39; strategy might be easy, but the company&#39;s success in product development continues to provide lessons to learn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of knowing when to say no seems obvious and is something you might say is always top of mind. But, if you&#39;re working on a product, you&#39;re likely to be challenged every day with decisions to say yes or no to the possible products you might design, and the features you might build into your products. Every one of these challenges requires courage to say no if the outcome compromises your vision, because in the moment it will seem like the world is begging for you to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know as a user of different products, I&#39;ve been vocal about the pet features I&#39;ve wanted as a &#34;power user&#34; of said products, and bitched when that voice didn&#39;t get heard. But I believe that the tech products that I continue to use and that are of value are those that hold onto a clearly defined vision and purpose, and whose features reflect that with selectivity and refusal to deviate from it. More often than not, to me, these products have provided a more focussed experience. &lt;/p&gt;

Or as I once heard on a cartoon as a kid&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;you have to work smarter not harder.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much more important than working hard is knowing how to find the right thing to work on. Paying attention to what is going on in the world. Seeing patterns. Seeing things as they are rather than how you want them to be. Being able to read what people want. Putting yourself in the right place where information is flowing freely and interesting new juxtapositions can be seen. But you can save yourself a lot of time by working on the right thing. Working hard, even, if that&amp;rsquo;s what you like to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved that paragraph. I also loved the anecdote about Watson and Crick, the scientists who discovered the structure of DNA, and how their discoveries didn&amp;rsquo;t come from hard work, as much as from being in the world thinking, experiencing, allowing ideas to happen. I think there&amp;rsquo;s a valuable nugget in there to product developers about that space that&amp;rsquo;s sometimes needed for creativity that isn&amp;rsquo;t valued enough and understood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating features to compete, building, and accretion without the relentlessness to say no and focus on the right things isn&amp;rsquo;t the path to quality and excellence. The right path in product development is kind of like finding the right path in life. Asking the hard questions about the things that matter and prioritizing effort around those things &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hard work. But it&amp;rsquo;s not working hard on the wrong problems, for the sake of working or existing. It&amp;rsquo;s defining what is meaningful and pursuing those thing with fervor. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;notebook-screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flashbulbinteraction.com/WTS_opening.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://media.konigi.com/notebook/flashbulb-working-screens.jpg&#34; class=&#34;notebook-image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flashbulb Interactions&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flashbulbinteraction.com/WTS_opening.html&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Working through Screens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent, well-illustrated ebook on concept design for designers and product developers. The key point here is how to use design tools and methodologies to get the right design for the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working through Screens is an online book for product teams creating new or iteratively improved applications for thinking work. Written for use during early, formative conversations, it provides teams with a broad range of considerations for setting the overall direction and priorities for their onscreen tools. With hundreds of envisioning questions and fictional examples from clinical research, financial trading, and architecture, this volume can help definers and designers to explore innovative new directions for their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product teams can make significant progress toward these aims by changing how they get started on designing their products — by beginning with an emphasis on getting to the right design strategy and design concepts long before getting to the right design details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can never be enough discussion in the literature on this topic in my opinion, because understanding the problem and getting the right design is so important for success, especially when it comes to application design. The book is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flashbulbinteraction.com/WTS_opening.html&#34;&gt;free to download&lt;/a&gt;, so check it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
