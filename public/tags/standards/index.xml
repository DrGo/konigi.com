Similar to the Web Standards Project, the Email Standards Project community works with email client developers and the design community to improve web standards support and accessibility in email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Measuring the Usability of Everyday Products</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/ISO20282.html&#34;&gt;David Travis reports&lt;/a&gt; for UserFocus on &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=34122&#34;&gt;ISO 2082, Ease of Operation of Every Day Products.&lt;/a&gt;&#34; While web-focussed interaction designers and information architects may not be involved in the design of everyday products, we should probably be interested at a high level, in the processes discussed. As Travis points out, clients are increasingly concerned with objective measurements of usability, and standards such as this &#34;...will help ensure that we have robust and reliable test methods for all interactive designs, whether these are products, software or web sites.&#34; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISO2082 is a new standard for the measurement of usability in everyday products. The document provides requirements and recommendations for the design of easy-to-operate everyday products. Its intended audience includes usability specialists, ergonomists, product designers, interaction designers, product manufacturers, and others involved in the design and development of everyday products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document is organized into 4 parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design requirements for context of use and user characteristics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test method for walk-up-and-use products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test method for consumer products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test method for the installation of consumer products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a designer of web products who only gets involved in discount usability testing, this standard is a curiosity to me more than anything. As Travis notes, testing consumer products is primarily concerned with determining if the product helps users achieve the most frequent and/or important user goal that the product is intended to support. So we&#39;re talking about tests of large groups over small sets of tasks in short periods of time. This is the kind of thing that is best handled by a dedicated usability team or consultant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we designers, at minimimum need only be aware of the process proposed here, and the relevance this may have with regard to having a standardized process to reference with clients or usability consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
