      <title>Apple&#39;s Design process</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Michael Lopp, Senior Engineering Manager at Apple discussed Apple&#39;s design process at a presentation given at SXSW. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/03/apples_design_p.html&#34;&gt;Business Week summarized the points&lt;/a&gt;, excerpted below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pixel Perfect Mockups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This, Lopp admitted, causes a huge amount of work and takes an enormous amount of time. But, he added, “it removes all ambiguity.” That might add time up front, but it removes the need to correct mistakes later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 to 3 to 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Apple designers come up with 10 entirely different mock ups of any new feature. Not, Lopp said, &#34;seven in order to make three look good&#34;, which seems to be a fairly standard practice elsewhere. They&#39;ll take ten, and give themselves room to design without restriction. Later they whittle that number to three, spend more months on those three and then finally end up with one strong decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paired Design Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was really interesting. Every week, the teams have two meetings. One in which to brainstorm, to forget about constraints and think freely. As Lopp put it: to &#34;go crazy&#34;. Then they also hold a production meeting, an entirely separate but equally regular meeting which is the other&#39;s antithesis. Here, the designers and engineers are required to nail everything down, to work out how this crazy idea might actually work. This process and organization continues throughout the development of any app, though of course the balance shifts as the app progresses. But keeping an option for creative thought even at a late stage is really smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pony Meeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This refers to a story Lopp told earlier in the session, in which he described the process of a senior manager outlining what they wanted from any new application: &#34;I want WYSIWYG... I want it to support major browsers... I want it to reflect the spirit of the company.&#34; Or, as Lopp put it: &#34;I want a pony!&#34; He added: &#34;Who doesn&#39;t? A pony is gorgeous!&#34; The problem, he said, is that these people are describing what they think they want. And even if they&#39;re misguided, they, as the ones signing the checks, really cannot be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution, he described, is to take the best ideas from the paired design meetings and present those to leadership, who might just decide that some of those ideas are, in fact, their longed-for ponies. In this way, the ponies morph into deliverables. And the C-suite, who are quite reasonable in wanting to know what designers are up to, and absolutely entitled to want to have a say in what&#39;s going on, are involved and included. And that helps to ensure that there are no nasty mistakes down the line.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this article, I heard someone in my office referring to dream features as ponies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apple TV 2.0 Review</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/apple-tv-2-0-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/apple-tv-2-0-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2086/2264703573_4e633e4413_o.png&#34; class=&#34;notebook-image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple TV owners got a software update pushed to their boxes this week, and Gizmodo &lt;a href=&#34;http://gizmodo.com/355843/apple-tv-20-review&#34;&gt;has a review of the software&lt;/a&gt; complete with screenshots and a description of the rental and purchase services now offered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a bit disappointed by the update at first, but like my 6 year old son said on the second day, &#34;I&#39;m getting used to it.&#34; Gone is the simple, single panel with left/right hierarchical navigation. That has been replaced by a 2 panel columnar navigation--left side for parent and right for it&#39;s children. Once you select the child in the right panel, that screen is taken over by a full screen interface, e.g. Movies &gt; My Movies &gt; Full screen movie list. Once you adjust to that change, the interface is quite intuitive actually, but I would have preferred the option to use the older UI if I prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UI for navigating your media is much simpler than that for navigating available video rentals. They&#39;ve taken to using the full screen to navigate movie rentals by the movie&#39;s poster image (with titles is smaller type) which is neat at first, but less eficient than quickly scrolling a list of titles. It might be simpler for young children, being able browse through images rather than skim titles, but it would have been nice to have the option of switching between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the technical issues in the first release have been dealt with as well. Synced and streamable media are now seamlessly navigable--you don&#39;t have to switch between sources. I also perceived there to be less buffering time when streaming video. They&#39;ve also added access to Flickr photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the service end, I, like many others, think the terms of service for video no demand are not so great. The prices are on par with DVD rental, but you have to watch the video within 30 days, and once you start, you only get to watch the video for 24 hours. This might make sense to most people, but not to parents with kids who rent a video and watch it repeatedly for a while before sending it back, e.g. to Netflix. It will be interesting to see if they&#39;re ever able to come up with a subscription model more like Netflix. That would certainly get a lot more interest in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think the user experience and convenience offered for people who have an interest in the Apple TV is a great improvement in this release. Check out more of the interface on the article at Engadget or the Apple TV Guided tour video below:&lt;/p&gt;
