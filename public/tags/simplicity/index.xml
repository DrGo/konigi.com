      <title>Don&amp;acirc;��t Simplify the UX. Curate.</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/done28099t-simplify-ux-curate/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jason Toth of Viget discusses the danger of blind devotion to simplification in design, and writes about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.viget.com/advance/dont-simplify-the-ux-curate/&#34;&gt;the role of UX designers as curators of content&lt;/a&gt;. He offers useful suggestions for how to play that role so we don&#39;t come off as content hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the argument for facilitating curation is as apt for feature selection and design as it is for content. I view the role of someone doing content strategy as being able to take in the glut of information for analysis and providing direction for how to deliver the message with greater efficiency and maybe at times, poetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curation and editing go hand in hand in my mind. It&#39;s as much the role of the curator to question the body of content to find the core of the message to deliver, as it is of the editor to guide a writer to find the lede. That could mean eliminating parts that detract from the message or it&#39;s delivery, rather than simply combining and compressing a lot into a small space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application interfaces provide problems similar to content. When taking in the number of possible use cases and stories that the application can support, a designer provides direction in terms of the delivery of an interface users interact with. On the interface side, it could mean questioning the necessity of the thing you&#39;re hiding for progressive disclosure, rather than finding clever ways to hide it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

Below is her summary of what dogs can teach us about interaction design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. It&#39;s important to know who is in charge.&lt;/strong&gt; Just like training a pet, a designer need to establish a rapport with clients that mixes trust and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to the tail.&lt;/strong&gt; A dog&#39;s tail communicates emotions silently, but it&#39;s easy to miss this detail if you are not paying attention. Interaction designers need to be aware of customer data for clues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Keep gestures simple.&lt;/strong&gt; Complicated hand gesture confuses a dog, and complicated language confuses users. Simplicity is best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good advice for communicating with humans and dogs alike. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.core77.com/blog/featured_items/dogs_on_design_danzicos_obedient_vizsla__16733.asp&#34;&gt;Read more on Core77&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The iPad is a Toy</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/ipad-toy/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;video&#34;&gt;
&lt;object width=&#34;610&#34; height=&#34;353&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://www.hulu.com/embed/0zBU5VwtAbk6NSdVTsxDbA/1425/1445/i1438&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://www.hulu.com/embed/0zBU5VwtAbk6NSdVTsxDbA/1425/1445/i1438&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34;  width=&#34;610&#34; height=&#34;353&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Apple said Monday that it sold more than 300,000 iPads on the day of its launch, ushering in a new era of people buying things to find out what they are.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Seth Meyer for Weekend Update on SNL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that it would be much more like an iPod Touch than a Mac netbook. But what I didn&amp;rsquo;t know until I &amp;ldquo;found out what it really was,&amp;rdquo; to quote Seth Meyer, was that it is for me better and more than I want from a netbook. I have a netbook. I use it so rarely that I ended up just tethering it to our second TV in the house. The iPad I use daily, because it is fun and it replaces my computer for a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I came across yet another article saying iPad wasn&amp;rsquo;t serious enough and that Apple would fail, as it did the PC market. There are a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=ipad+is+a+toy&#34;&gt;articles on this theme&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to mostly compare it to laptops and netbooks. They said the same thing about the iPhone as well. I don&amp;rsquo;t think these people get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I tweeted, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading articles dismissing iPad as a toy &amp;amp; not a tool, as if to say toys have no value. Guess what? Toys are fun.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/MichaelSurtees/status/12614483471&#34;&gt;Michael Surtees replied&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;interesting @konigi —have you read the next big thing will start out looking like a toy at cdixon.org &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/6MZqQR&#34;&gt;http://bit.ly/6MZqQR&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Dixon&amp;rsquo;s blog entry, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/&#34;&gt;The next big thing will start out looking like a toy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; nails it on the head. This is a disruptive device that people don&amp;rsquo;t seem to understand and appear to be dismissing without really experiencing it long enough to know why it&amp;rsquo;s interesting. These are the people that focus on the feature set only, and don&amp;rsquo;t think about the bigger ripple this will make in expanding people&amp;rsquo;s use with both the personal and networked experiences. The similarities in the confusion the iPad is creating among people who don&amp;rsquo;t get it are similar to those initial reactions with the Wii, Twitter, iPod, and iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, the experience (the interface and interaction) is the product. You don&amp;rsquo;t get it until you live with it. It was the same with those examples above. And when you get, you get it big. There&amp;rsquo;s the same gratification of understanding the multi-touch gestures. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT4EbM7dCMs&#34;&gt;Two year olds&lt;/a&gt; get that. I even caught my 9 year old son trying to swipe the LCD on our camera last week. Then slowly you get that it&amp;rsquo;s useful in ways you didn&amp;rsquo;t expect and that most importantly, it&amp;rsquo;s more fun than you thought it would be. The apps help there. You like it. You like enough that you bring it everywhere and because it&amp;rsquo;s bigger than your iPhone, you realize it&amp;rsquo;s more usable for things like watching movies or playing Plants Vs Zombies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are limitations. After years of believing and playing the feature wars game with Windows Mobile and Palm, I had a hard time with the iPhone initially. But I used the iPhone more and more and never regretted that I can&amp;rsquo;t use Excel or whatever else I could do with those smart phones that really were &amp;ldquo;tools&amp;rdquo; crammed into a PDA disguised as a phone. This is the longest I&amp;rsquo;ve stuck with one brand of phone, and you want to know why? It&amp;rsquo;s because I enjoy using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPad is no different to me than the iPhone when it comes to the experience of the apps. There are tools on it that I&amp;rsquo;m going to make an effort at using. By tools, I mean those that aren&amp;rsquo;t just media consumption apps. I&amp;rsquo;m making an effort to try to use OmniGraffle, Sketchbook Pro, and Pages. They won&amp;rsquo;t be replacements for my Mac versions, but they will be stand-ins when I&amp;rsquo;m away from the desk. In those situations, it is good enough, and I think with time I will learn to work simply and it may turn out to provide better experiences. To speed my adoption, I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with leaving pen and paper at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iPad is brutally selective on features, and comes up short compared to the world of user expectations. There is no camera, there is no 3G yet, there is no multi-tasking yet, and there is no printing. It builds off the experience of the iPhone, and it expands it to include the utility of the apps for simple productivity and creativity, while keeping the size and weight lean, and the battery life satisfying for an entire day. It even excels providing simpler experiences than those the tool-overloaded laptops and netbooks can provide. It&amp;rsquo;s an everyday experience, it&amp;rsquo;s a conference device, it&amp;rsquo;s a commuter device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is a toy to me, but I don&amp;rsquo;t say that to put it down. Toys make me happy. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time a tool really made me as happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/&#34;&gt;http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>To Change Effectively, Change Just One Thing</title>

wt4acce97265132_1.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Bregman writes about how &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/bregman/2009/10/i-lost-18-pounds-in.html&#34;&gt;finding the simplest solution provides the most effective path to change&lt;/a&gt;. In his story he talks about how changing one thing, one habit or pattern of behavior, permitted him to be effective at losing weight. This simple strategy contrasts with the multitude of diet books that suggest entire regimine of change in order to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a great tale that Bregman uses to illustrate how simplifying a process or dealing with a challenge can sometimes be most effectively handled by reducing it to its essence, and devoting 100% of energy on a singular action. I think there&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that this practice, whether it&amp;rsquo;s in finding a touch point for a strategy or determining a singular idea behind a project&amp;rsquo;s goal is pretty powerful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see this kind of focus working well for me if I remember to keep the one thing in mind. I&amp;rsquo;m finding the idea compelling enough that I tacked it on my wall to remind me of the focus of my current project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>John Maeda on Simplicity at Apple, and the Future of Design</title>

wt4abcd995ce216.jpg&#39;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Maeda wrote a short article for Huffington Post about simplicity and humanizing design, what it has meant for the software developed on Apple products, and what it means for the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The respect so many designers have for Apple is possibly bourne out of reverence for the philosophies that lead to reduction, simplicity, and the humanizing of user interfaces. Maeda talks about Jonathan Ive in this regard, citing his ability to make something real and human by getting his hands dirty. These people, he says, are the ones who will drive creativity and innovation in what they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maeda&amp;rsquo;s take on the future of design seems to be that the national emphasis on left-brain thinking alone will not be enough to drive economic development. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Barry Schwartz on the Paradox of Choice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;video&#34;&gt;
&lt;object width=&#34;334&#34; height=&#34;326&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;wmode&#34; value=&#34;transparent&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;bgColor&#34; value=&#34;#ffffff&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name=&#34;flashvars&#34; value=&#34;vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/embed/BarrySchwartz_2005G-embed_high.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/BarrySchwartz-2005G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=320&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=93&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf&#34; pluginspace=&#34;http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; wmode=&#34;transparent&#34; bgColor=&#34;#ffffff&#34; width=&#34;334&#34; height=&#34;326&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; flashvars=&#34;vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/embed/BarrySchwartz_2005G-embed_high.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/BarrySchwartz-2005G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=320&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=93&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;dek&#34;&gt;Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies on TED: freedom of choice. In Schwartz&amp;rsquo;s estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more dissatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that more choice leads to paralysis rather than happiness resonates strongly with me. I think about where I am in terms of my spiritual and psychological development, and I do feel dissatisfied when things aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect today and I find it troublesome that I think this way. But I do remember where choices of some things were limited, although that period may have been very short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Westerner, I think the number of choices put in front of me for any particular consumer item has been overwhelmingly many. Schwartz says this abundance causes many of us to have difficulty making decisions. We become paralyzed. And even when we&amp;rsquo;re able to overcome the paralysis, we end up feeling less satisfied. The more options there are, the easier it is to regret choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is terribly sad, but it is a reality we deal with as interface designers as well. As someone who is working on an incredibly complex piece of software&amp;#8212;so complex that I struggle to understand some of the more powerful, yet obscure features&amp;#8212;the challenge is enormous. If people experience this flood of choice and paralysis in their everyday experience, you can damn well be sure that they&amp;rsquo;re not going to tolerate it when they have to use your software to get their job done. Or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll tolerate it and be pissed off all the time about it. So you&amp;rsquo;d better work extra hard not to piss them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this comes down to making decisions for people. If you have to have the obscure, less utilized feature, the challenge is to find a way to enable its use without creating a cognitive cost in what you present for the primary use cases. We utilize progressive disclosure for some of these things. It&amp;rsquo;s hard work making decisions to make things less prominent or to cut features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about this great screenshot of the Zune from Giles Colborne&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/cxpartners/secrets-of-simplicity&#34;&gt;Secrets of Simplicity&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; presentation. When the Zune removed features it got better reviews. That may only be perceived improvement, but it most likely also reflects better decision making around what&amp;rsquo;s necessary rather than about keeping ahead of pace with the market in terms of growing features, something that Microsoft software is notorious for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://media.konigi.com/notebook/zune-simplicity.jpg&#34; style=&#34;max-width:310px !important;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s the job we have to do as UX designers arguing on behalf of the silent user. I think of this like being the lawyer representing a body of plaintiffs that&amp;rsquo;s suffered damaged due to neglect. Some software companies can defend the position that they&amp;rsquo;ve made decisions based on what they thought people wanted (more choice) and get away with that. The other aspect of choice is that people can also decide to stop patronizing you and buying your software. The smart companies take notice, become accountable, and invest in making things right even if its at a cost in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This the mentality we have to take, and the arguments we have to make when looking at the glut of decisions we present users with. We need to be accountable to those who pay us to use our products. The flip side of choice is this. More is not always better. Less is not exactly more. Best is providing the right options at the right time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The readbag bookmarking service (it&amp;rsquo;s actually a Google App Engine application) provides the functionality to do one thing very well&amp;ndash;bookmark pages that you want to read for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might argue that you can use any social bookmarking service to do this, or something like Evernote. But what readbag does well is eliminates all the noise of social bookmarking, and gives you a nice mobile interface (generic mobile ui or IUI for iPhones) so that you can retrieve those articles you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to read now. So when you&amp;rsquo;re on a train maybe, or waiting in line somewhere, you can read them on your phone. The little twist is that it acts a bit like a to do list. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve followed a link from the readbag interface to one of those saved articles, it gets removed from the list, assuming that you&amp;rsquo;ve now you read it. You can unarchive links if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read them yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes a long way towards making my iphone more useful as someone who is constantly finding blog entries and articles to read, but not being able to read them all when I&amp;rsquo;m at the computer. What would really work well for someone like me, who occasionally is out of reach of a cell tower signal, is an application that can create a text-only version, cached on my phone so that I can read those articles on the subway. Of course, if iPhone&amp;rsquo;s Safari ever does offline reading this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very well implemented product design for a service that wants to be simple. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
