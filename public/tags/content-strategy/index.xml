      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jason Toth of Viget discusses the danger of blind devotion to simplification in design, and writes about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.viget.com/advance/dont-simplify-the-ux-curate/&#34;&gt;the role of UX designers as curators of content&lt;/a&gt;. He offers useful suggestions for how to play that role so we don&#39;t come off as content hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the argument for facilitating curation is as apt for feature selection and design as it is for content. I view the role of someone doing content strategy as being able to take in the glut of information for analysis and providing direction for how to deliver the message with greater efficiency and maybe at times, poetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curation and editing go hand in hand in my mind. It&#39;s as much the role of the curator to question the body of content to find the core of the message to deliver, as it is of the editor to guide a writer to find the lede. That could mean eliminating parts that detract from the message or it&#39;s delivery, rather than simply combining and compressing a lot into a small space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application interfaces provide problems similar to content. When taking in the number of possible use cases and stories that the application can support, a designer provides direction in terms of the delivery of an interface users interact with. On the interface side, it could mean questioning the necessity of the thing you&#39;re hiding for progressive disclosure, rather than finding clever ways to hide it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
