      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of two things a lot with the holidays arriving. The first is, how can I provide a discount on Konigi stuff to my friends who use the notepads and sketchbooks. The second is, how can I find a way to make my Christmastime donations interesting. When I was an avid Lala trader a few years ago, I tried to see if I could get one of the many CDs sleeves I marked back and vowed to make my donations coincide with the event. I never got a sleeve back, but made the donations anyway and was included in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122201191.html&#34;&gt;WashPost article&lt;/a&gt; because I tend do end of year charitable giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I ran a discount code for Black Friday/Cyber Monday. This year, however, I thought I would forego a discount and instead donate 50% of all sales revenue&amp;ndash;not just profit, but all sales&amp;ndash; to 2 charities. I figure the cost of these little sketchbooks and tools is not so great, and we can all give a little while getting something back. The donations will be made to 2 local organizations devoted to fighting poverty and hunger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Beneficiaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.robinhood.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../sites/konigi.com/ads/robinhood-logo.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Robin Hood&lt;/strong&gt; is an organization that gives 100% of donations to poverty-fighting organizations with programs focussing on Early Childhood, Education, Jobs &amp;amp; Economic Security, and Survival, and uses sound investment principles to sustain in its philanthropic mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.foodbanknyc.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../sites/konigi.com/ads/nyfb-logo.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The New York Food Bank&lt;/strong&gt; organizes food, information and support for community survival and dignity. Working to end food poverty and increase access to affordable, nutritious food for low-income New Yorkers throughout the five boroughs, the Food Bank&amp;rsquo;s initiatives focus on direct services, food sourcing and distribution, nutrition and health education, financial empowerment, disaster relief and policy and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Participate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for participating with me. &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.konigi.com/?q=store&#34;&gt;When you buy one of the Konigi products in the store&lt;/a&gt;, you are making a small contribution to these philanthropic organizations . I will be doing an update to the icons to help entice you to make your purchase. I feel fortunate to have something to trade for dollars in donations, and to have the help of my friends and readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
