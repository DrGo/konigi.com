<p><a href="http://getreframer.com/">Reframer</a> is a collaborative web app for collecting and analyzing qualitative data. You start by capturing data into the app&#8212;things like customer feedback, free text responses in surveys, emails, interviews, and usability test data. The system then uses the aggregated information and provides a view reframed with quantitative values based on a significance rating that team members apply. These values can also be used to prioritize issues to assess feasibility. The metadata additionally allows you to identify trends and themes, and show relationships in data based on correlated tags. </p>
<p>Looks like a fantastic way to get all of that data out of spreadsheets and into a living tool for both quick capture and simpler analysis. They offer tiered plans from free to $249. Paid plans come with 30 days free. <a href="http://getreframer.com/">More info here</a>.</p>
