<p>The web-based tool allows you to build multiple prototypes using a combination of standard HTML/CSS. If you can do JS, the standard JS libraries are available to include in your pages (or sheets in Quplo lingo).</p>

<p>Quplo provides some really simple syntax and markup language, called &quot;flow,&quot; for creating variables, loops, conditionals, layouts (like master templates), parts (reusable pieces of code like UI components, menus, etc.), and including browser, get and post vars.</p>

<p>You can even specify a &quot;redesign&quot; prototype and provide a URL, and it'll ingest the HTML for that page as a starting point for your prototype. Cobble together a bunch of pages and you have an interactive HTML prototype to demonstrate your pages and state changes. If you need to, you can download a compressed .zip of the XML files in your project.</p>

<p>This is easily the best thing I've seen for HTML prototyping for non-programmers that I've seen. It's like what my Protokit wanted to grow up to be. :) Sick stuff for the UX k1Ddi35. You can bet I'm going to campaign for a way to get Mockups into this tool.</p>
