I had to configure a new computer for myself because of a recent job change, so that meant installing all of my design/development tools again. On my new MacBook Pro, I run VMWare and just ran Tredosoft's Multiple IE Installer for Windows XP. On an XP machine with IE7 (you must upgrade to IE7 before running this), the application will allow you to select versions of IE 3, 4, 5, and 6 to install. I've had it working on my last 3 Macs running Windows on both Parallels and VMWare without any problems. </p>
