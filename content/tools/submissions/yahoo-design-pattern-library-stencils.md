Design Pattern Library have released <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/wireframes/">stencils for design patterns</a> in OmniGraffle, Visio, PDF, PNG, and SVG format. I had planned to do the same for OmniGraffle users, but they beat me to the punch. :) This has easily become the best resource out there for design pattern examples. Congrats to Christian Crumlish and his team.</p>
