This is something I typically do at the start of a usability test to see what users understand at a high level. Show them a screen, take it away, have them talk, ask them questions. There's more about this method at <a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/five_second_test/">UIE</a>. This site provides a service so you can easily do this kind of thing with users by generating a test and providing a link you can share with participants to take it. The service then emails you the results. </p>
