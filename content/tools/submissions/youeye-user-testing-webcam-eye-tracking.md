The usability testing service allows you to create remote, unmoderated usability test sessions with a small number of tasks, and using the test participant's web browser and web cam, they record eye-tracking results during the test. The service allows you to use paid self-identified test participants from different demographics. Would hope that you could recruit your own testers as well.</p>
