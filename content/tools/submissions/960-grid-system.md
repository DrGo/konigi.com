Each has 10px gutters on either side or 20px combined between columns. </p>
<p>960 px was chosen as a base number because it is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 32, 40, 48, 60, 64, 80, 96, 120, 160, 192, 240, 320 and 480. Seems like fairly flexible system, although I find the classes in use on Blueprint, particularly when nesting, to be a little simpler.</p>
