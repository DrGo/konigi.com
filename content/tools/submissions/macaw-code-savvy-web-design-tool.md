<p>There are some great optimizations for nudging/pudging on a grid, and for setting properties that make sense for cssâ€”thinking of positioning and dimensions.</p>

<p>The outline view is a nice way to browse through all the groups in the  document and adding container tags and/or classes for semantic html publishing. It's well matched to how you'd think in html. It leap-frogs the heavier prototyping tools, but it's limited to creating static pages, like comps, for now. I'm not sure what the graphics output options will be.</p>

<p>The html export is clean, maybe cleaner and more efficient than what I would write because it's a robot. Look really interesting, and is yet another approach to designing more directly for the browser.</p>
