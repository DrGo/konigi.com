The fine folks at <a href="http://pointlesscorp.com/">Pointless Corp (aka Viget)</a> created this as a side project for handling scheduling of user interviews and testing, but could be used for any kind of event.</p>

<p>There are other apps like this that remove the fuss of coordinating schedules via email. PowWow does it simply, and provides a polished and pleasing experience. You pick the times that work best for you and send out a calendar with available appointments and any additional information to potential participants. Participants can select the appointment time that works best for them and you will be sent a confirmation with their contact information.</p>
