<p>The script allows you to enter the series of columns that should be laid out both horizontally and vertically. Then you set the maximum dimensions for the canvas. To generate a Blueprint grid, for instance, you'd enter "30,10" to create a PSD with a series of repeating columns of alternating 30 pixel units and 10 pixel gutters. You can set any number of columns in the series.</p>
<p>The script is saved into your Photoshop "Preset / Scripts" directory and is summoned by selecting "File $gt; Scripts." </p>
