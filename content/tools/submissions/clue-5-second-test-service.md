<p>To use, enter a URL for a page you'd like to test, they generate a screenshot, and provide you with URLs for the test and the test report. Here's an example using this site: <a href="http://www.clueapp.com/27951">test</a> and <a href="http://www.clueapp.com/27951+">report</a>. Feel free to mock my home page at will. ;)</p>

<p>Users will see a screen with these brief instructions, &quot;Look at this screenshot and remember what you see,&quot; and upon clicking the Take the Test button, they are flashed the screenshot for 5.5 seconds. Afterwards they're given 5 inputs to describe what they remember seeing. Go to <a href="http://www.clueapp.com/">Clue App</a> to create your own.</p>
