<p>I like that these gives you a surface to work on that can be re-arranged easily on a table and presented on a metallic wall. They have some good screenshots using them arranged on a whiteboard with flow arrows pointing between them, which is another thing that's probably much easier with these as opposed to using paper. Dry-erase also saves paper, which is nice. You'll just have to photograph your work, or make sure you have enough of them to keep making more screens.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cohdoo.com/">Cohdoo</a> guys have web browser magnets planned as well. I'm looking forward to getting my hands on those to review as well.</p>
