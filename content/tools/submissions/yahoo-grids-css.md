UI Library's Grids CSS framework</a> might seem hard to grok at first, but I've been using it for the past year on a commercial project and find that it's solid for liquid CSS layouts. The <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/builder/">grid builder</a> helps to visualize what's possible and view the rather obscure naming conventions they use in CSS classes.</p>
<p>The framework offers four preset page widths, six preset templates, and the ability to stack and nest subdivided regions of two, three, or four columns.</p>
