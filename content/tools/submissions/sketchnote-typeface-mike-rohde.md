Mike created the font for the Sketchnote handbook and <a href="http://rohdesign.com/weblog/2013/5/29/the-sketchnote-typeface.html">writes about its design on his blog</a>. The family has four fonts: Sketchnote Text in Reg­ular, Bold and Italic, plus Sketchnote Square.</p>

<p><blockquote>Sketchnote Text is a friendly, casual script with a bouncy baseline and a warm texture. To emulate natural hand­writing, OpenType features auto­matically switch be­tween multiple versions of each letter or number, with over 240 alter­nates in each text font. OpenType kerning classes are used with unique kerns made to tame pairings of all those wily alter­nates for con­sistent spacing.</blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote>Sketchnote Square is a bold, somewhat com­pressed head­line type that complements the text fonts. Drawn in­stead of written, the characters in Square have neat little hap­pen­stance voids within the strokes. Square also fea­tures a handy selection of fun icons, rules, and arrows—some functional tidbits for your design projects.</blockquote></p>

<p>I've already purchased a license for myself and used it in Mockups and it's outstanding. You can peep it <a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/1q310l1o280X110o1Q40/Sketchnote_Font.png" class="group">in a wireframe here</a>. The character there is perfect.</p>

<p>You can download the whole family for $99, or by individual fonts for $29. <a href="http://www.delvefonts.com/sketchnote.html">More info at Delve.</a></p>
