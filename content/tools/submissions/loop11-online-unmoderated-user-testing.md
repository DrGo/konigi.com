<p>Loop11 provides the ability to gain detailed insights and understandings of user behaviour.  These insights are obtained via a live interactive environment where users are asked to complete a series of tasks and questions on your website or interface.  All interactions are captured, processed and made available in real-time reports.</p>
<p>Loop11 is not a survey or web analytics tool, but a user experience tool helping you to understand user behaviour.</p>
