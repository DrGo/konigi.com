Plus it can be really enjoyable to write real fake copy. Having said that, I have to admit to being the lazy IA from time to timeand have gone to gone to <a href="http://lipsum.com/">lipsum.com</a> to generate dummy text. </p>
<p>Another thing I do is go to silly blogs and copy the text there. Dwight Schrute's <a href="http://blog.nbc.com/DwightsBlog/">Schrute Space</a> has been a great resource for that lately, since I'm working on a TV-related site with user generated content. This at least makes my copy look semi-real. </p>
<p>But if I have to resort to dummy text, I think I'll be going to the <a href="http://www.blindtextgenerator.com/">Blind Text Generator</a> rather than lipsum.com. This dummy text offers you a few options, from Cicero's standby Lorem Ipsum greeking to a passage from Kafka's <i>Metamorphosis</i>. You'll never have to deliver boring copy again--in your wireframes at least.</p>
