<p><a href="https://github.com/djaiss/mapsicon">Mapsicon</a> is a free collection of maps for nearly every country in the world, available as PNG in 11 different sizes, ranging from 16x16 pixels to 1024x1024 pixels, as well as in .svg format. Useful for placeholders or for illustrative purposes, rather than for precise rendering of geography.</p>
