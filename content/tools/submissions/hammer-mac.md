<p>Hammer does includes without PHP, compiles Coffeescript to JS, SASS/SCSS to CSS, has an auto-refresh feature for never having to reload the browser, and provides some simple to use helpers. Since it knows about all of the files in your projects, you just reference names and it knows how to build out paths. It has a helper for selected link classes in your navigation elements. When you're ready to share your prototype you can upload to your own server, zip and send the Build folder, or use their own built in publishing system.</p>
