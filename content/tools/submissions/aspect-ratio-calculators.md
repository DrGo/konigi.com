In my <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Rapid-Wireframing-Finding-the-Right-Product-Design/1947996659/">Skillshare course</a> there's a brief moment where I show a ratio calculator that I use for doing things like figuring out dimensions of containers while designing.

The idea is simple. You have a ratio like 16:9, 4:3, 9:6, etc. and want to see how to scale another object with that ratio using a fixed dimension, e.g. you know the width.

Here are a few that I like:

<a href="http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/aspect_ratio/">Aspect Ratio Calculator</a>, a free web calculator by Andrew Hedges that I've used for years.

<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aspect-ratio-calculator/id498701237">Aspect Ratio Calculator for Mac</a>, by  David Wolf. Available via the Mac App Store for $3.99.

<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aspect-ratio-calculator/klgkjdnciknlegnojnpgpofagaophdei">Aspect Ratio Calculator for Chrome</a>, a Google Chrome extension that's always available if you're working in the browser.
