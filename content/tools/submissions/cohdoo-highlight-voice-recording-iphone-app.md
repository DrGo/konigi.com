It's aimed at helping user researchers record interviews, and is just as useful for recording meetings and conference talks.</p>

<p>To start new sessions, press the New Recording button, and during the recording you can tap the huge green Mark Highlight button, which I could see being useful for marking new questions during interviews, or marking sections of conference talks. Afterwards during playback, you can press a marker to jump to it, and swipe a marker to label it. You can then sync and access your recordings via iTunes, or email the audio recordings.  Really nice app. I can see myself using this for more than just user research recordings.</p>
