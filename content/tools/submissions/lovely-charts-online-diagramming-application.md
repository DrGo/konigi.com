I like the unique, simple method they provide for quickly creating flow charts and site maps. In this screencast I show how to do a few simple flow diagrams and a wireframe, as well as discussing the features that I'd like to see for creating prototypes from this tool. I think what they're providing in this first release is very promising and will be one to watch if you're interested in this kind of thing. The video below gives you a preview of some of the app's capabilities.</p>

<p>As with all of the Flash-based tools, there's not nearly as much control in the output, but it's useful for light needs. Light, quick, and dirty is a good thing.</p>
