The kit provides droppable interface elements for demonstrating rich interactions like editing in place, lightbox effects, video embedding, and a bunch more. </p>
<p>When I worked in a Windows only company, we used Axure and I loved how easy it made wireframing and prototyping simple interactions by just dragging and dropping. This tool kit will definitely make the job even easier. Axure users, this is not to be missed.</p>
