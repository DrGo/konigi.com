With this jquery plugin included on a page, you'll be able to select individual elements and write css code for it right in your browser. Changes are updated on the fly, so you can see your style changes as you write them.</p>

<p>The CSS generated by your edits can then be generated and copy-pasted into your stylesheet file for minor edits.</p>

<p>This is a really useful if you like the live-update abilities of Firebug on Firefox but would like a cleaner way to export your css changes.</p>
