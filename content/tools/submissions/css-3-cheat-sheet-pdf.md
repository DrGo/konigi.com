<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/13/css-3-cheat-sheet-pdf/">Smashing Magazine's printable CSS 3 Cheat Sheet</a> provides a complete listing of all the properties, selectors types and allowed values in the current CSS 3 specification from the W3C. Each property is provided in a section that attempts to match it with the section (module) that it is most actively associated within the W3C specification. Next to each property is a listing of the expected values that that property takes (normal text shows named values it accepts and italics shows value types it will accept).</p>
