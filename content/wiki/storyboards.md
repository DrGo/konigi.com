<h2 id="toc0">Definitions</h2>
<p>Storyboarding is the technique interaction designers and information architects have adopted from film and animation to specify interaction in user interfaces. Storyboards in interaction design typically show a sequence of key frames that depict when a change in state occurs in the interface. They are often illustrated with a linear, multi-cell diagram, often accompanied by annotations to describe the actions taken by the user, and the responses or behavior of the system.</p>

Storyboards provide a synopsis for a proposed story (or a complex scene) involving its action and characters.</p>
