<h2 id="toc0">Definition</h2>
<p>Usability testing is the measurement of the <a class="" href="../node/1429.html">usability</a> of a product or service. The definition from usability.gov succinctly describes the process.</p>

<p>In a usability test, representative users try to do typical tasks with the product, while observers, including the development staff, watch, listen, and take notes. The product can be a Web site, Web application, or any other product. It does not have to be a finished product. You should be testing prototypes from early paper-based stages through fully functional later stages.</p>

<p>Source: &quot;<a href="http://www.usability.gov/refine/learnusa.html">Learn About Usability Testing</a>.&quot; <em>Usability.gov</em></p>

<p>Note that the process of usability testing differs from usability engineering, which is concerned the research and design of usable products, rather than testing a product's usability.</p>
