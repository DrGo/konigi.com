<h2 id="toc0">Definitions</h2>
<p>A pattern describes an optimal solution to a common problem within a specific context.</p>

<p>From the IAWiki:</p>

<dl>
        <dd>Patterns are optimal solutions to common problems. As common problems are tossed around a community and are resolved, common solutions often spontaneously emerge. Eventually, the best of these rise above the din and self-identify and become refined until they reach the status of a Design Pattern.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Each pattern has four primary components:</p>

<ol>
    <li> a title</li>
    <li> a problem</li>
    <li> a context</li>
    <li> a solution</li>
</ol>

<p>A design pattern in architecture and computer science is a formal way of documenting a solution to a design problem in a particular field of expertise. The idea was introduced by the architect Christopher Alexander in the field of architecture, and has been adapted for various other disciplines, including computer science.</p>

<p>An organized collection of design patterns that relate to a particular field is called a pattern language.</p>

<h2 id="toc1">Discussion</h2>
<p>In essence, patterns are structural and behavioral features that improve the &quot;habitability&quot; of something -- a user interface, a Web site, an object-oriented program, or even a building. They make things more usable, easier to understand, or more beautiful; they make tools more ready-to-hand.</p>

<p>As such, patterns can be a description of best practices within a given design domain. They capture common solutions to design tensions (usually called &quot;forces&quot; in pattern literature) and thus, by definition, are not novel. They aren't off-the-shelf components; each implementation of a pattern is a little different from every other. They aren't simple rules or heuristics either. And they won't walk you through an entire set of design decisions...</p>
