<p>Goal Directed Design is an interaction design methodology created by Cooper that identifies the goals and behaviors of users, and the goals of a business, and directly translates these into design.</p>

<p>The process is broken down into the following steps, according to the <a href="http://www.cooper.com/about/process/">process page</a> on the Cooper site.</p>

<ul>
    <li> Project Planning</li>
    <li> Research</li>
    <li> Modeling</li>
    <li> Requirements</li>
    <li> Framework</li>
    <li> Refinement</li>
    <li> Support</li>
</ul>

<p>A more detailed description of the tasks associated with this process are described in &quot;<a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/goal_directed_design/">Goal-Directed Design: An Interview with Kim Goodwin</a>,&quot; by Christine Perfetti on the <em>User Interface Engineering</em> site.</p>
