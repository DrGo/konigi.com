<h2 id="toc0">Definitions</h2>
<p>Dark Patterns are interface design patterns that have been designed to trick users into doing things they wouldn’t otherwise have done.</p>

<p>The term was coined by Harry Brignull, who writes on <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/">DarkPatterns.org</a>, that they are carefully crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the user’s interests in mind. In the talk Brignull gave at UX Brighton 2010, he calls for a code of ethics among professionals in the user interface design industries, and for professional associations to acknowledge that these practices are unethical.</p>
