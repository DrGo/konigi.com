<p>The good news is that Jeff Parks did an amazing job of capturing the sessions and producing audio podcasts, which are <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/ia-summit-10-day-1">now available via Boxes and Arrows</a> or by subscribing to the podcast <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/boxes-and-arrows-podcast/id275459507">via iTunes</a>. Currently the keynotes and all of the sessions from Day 1 are available.</p>
