<p>Huge has announced <a href="http://www.hugeinc.com/news/noticed/huge-launches-ux-school-for-international-design-talent">HUGE UX School</a>, a graduate program for design talent interested in pursuing careers in User Experience.</p>

<p>Ten students, selected from hundreds of international applicants, will join HUGE’s UX team in New York, where they will receive three months of hands-on training and learn the fundamentals of UX design.</p>

<p>HUGE started the school to help prepare design professionals for successful careers in interaction design and to find and cultivate industry talent. Students in this year’s class come from the United States, Korea, Italy, Dominican Republic and Germany and have backgrounds in industrial, graphic, and interactive design as well as architecture and human-computer interaction.</p>

<p>UX trainees will be integrated into the existing HUGE UX team and each will be assigned a mentor. Students will learn the basics of interaction design, from developing user scenarios and wireframes to conducting competitive analyses and user testing, and learn how IDs at HUGE solve problems. Additionally, students will be responsible for executing a full project from brief through to design. Select students will be offered full time positions with HUGE following the completion of the program.</p>
