The service let's you create your own Twitter-clone microblogging site, as does Yammer, but without any constraints regarding who you may invite. Alas, I can't say that I know what the experience is like because I couldn't get past the front door, so I walked away possibly never to return.</p>
<p>So here's the criticism, and my advice for how not to run a product alpha/beta. </p>
<p>1) Don't put a very prominent form to create an account on your front page if this is what you happens when you submit.</p>
<div class="notebook-image"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/konigi/notebook/twingr.jpg" /></div>
<p>2) Don't make a second create button on the page (see bottom of the first screenshot) that does nothing when you click it.</p>
<p>3) Don't do all the above, blocking people from registering, and then leave out a sign up for beta form to remind prospective customers to come back. I won't remember ever hearing about this site and probably won't likely be back if not reminded.</p>
<p>First impressions matter, and I know it can be very difficult to recover from a bad first impression with a product. If I were these guys, I would make those few fixes real fast.</p>
