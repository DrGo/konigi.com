I think about these ideas in terms of my workspace, and try to seek out the same sense of interior and exterior space, quiet solitude inside and energy outside, detail and larger context, closeness and vastness. It reminds of what Bruce Springsteen said about keeping 2 opposing ideas in your head at one time.</li>
