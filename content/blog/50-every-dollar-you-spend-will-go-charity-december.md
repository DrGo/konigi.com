  <h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>I've been thinking of two things a lot with the holidays arriving. The first is, how can I provide a discount on Konigi stuff to my friends who use the notepads and sketchbooks. The second is, how can I find a way to make my Christmastime donations interesting. When I was an avid Lala trader a few years ago, I tried to see if I could get one of the many CDs sleeves I marked back and vowed to make my donations coincide with the event. I never got a sleeve back, but made the donations anyway and was included in a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122201191.html">WashPost article</a> because I tend do end of year charitable giving.</p>
<p>Last year I ran a discount code for Black Friday/Cyber Monday. This year, however, I thought I would forego a discount and instead donate 50% of all sales revenue--not just profit, but all sales-- to 2 charities. I figure the cost of these little sketchbooks and tools is not so great, and we can all give a little while getting something back. The donations will be made to 2 local organizations devoted to fighting poverty and hunger. </p>
