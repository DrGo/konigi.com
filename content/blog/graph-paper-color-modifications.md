<p>I made some color modifications to the <a href="../tools/graph-paper.html">graph paper</a>, bumping the cyan of the non-photo lines up slightly. I was noticing that when I print these in grayscale on a black and white laser printer, that the blues were a bit too pale to print clearly. This version works very well when printed. Color printer users will still be able to knock out the blue.</p>
