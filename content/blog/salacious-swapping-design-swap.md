It's better, because it's an exhibitionist, one-to-one CSS Zen Garden style swap of designs between two designer's sites. And we get to be the voyeurs. Salacious.</p>

<p>It's a shame that they didn't pick up on the wife swap theme like I did, and go with a '70s disco, swinging aesthetic. Those round portraits could have people with fros and big butterfly collars. Opportunity missed.</p>
