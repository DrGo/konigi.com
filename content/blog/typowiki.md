The wiki is "a user-created encyclopedia of all things type and design-related. Users create and edit Wiki entries with the aim of becoming a collaborative, useful, balanced and relevant resource."</p>
<p>This is a very simple wiki created on top of Drupal. They've done a nice job of creating a core set of wiki pages ("indices", as they call them) linked off the front so you can edit those pages and create forward links to new resources. This is a nice approach that the keeps the site organized and clean. </p>
<p>There's quite a lot of content in here already, including a pretty large glossary of terms. Wherever you see a little red W icon, the content needs to be written still, so get in there if you're so inclined and contribute.</p>
