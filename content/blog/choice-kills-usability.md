<p>John S. Rhodes offers a great reminder in this short article on <i>Apogee</i> of how to <a href="http://www.apogeehk.com/articles/ChoiceKillsUsability.html">focus narrowly on singular goals to increase usability</a>. </p>
<p>Key things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the easiest ways to improve usability is by focusing on just one thing.</li>
<li>Provide a clear vision. Be practical. Focus for usability.</li>
</ul>
