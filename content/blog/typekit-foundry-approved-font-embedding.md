<p>Jeff Veen <a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2009/05/27/introducing-typekit/">announces Typekit</a>, a solution for providing foundry-approved font embedding on the web. More info below from the Typkekit blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve been working with foundries to develop a consistent web-only font linking license. We’ve built a technology platform that lets us to host both free and commercial fonts in a way that is incredibly fast, smoothes out differences in how browsers handle type, and offers the level of protection that type designers need without resorting to annoying and ineffective DRM.</p>
<p>As a Typekit user, you’ll have access to our library of high-quality fonts. Just add a line of JavaScript to your markup, tell us what fonts you want to use, and then craft your pages the way you always have. Except now you’ll be able to use real fonts.</p></blockquote>
