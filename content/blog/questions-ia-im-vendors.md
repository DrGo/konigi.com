<p>Lou Rosenfeld shares the <a href="http://louisrosenfeld.com/home/bloug_archive/2008/05/questions_for_iaim_vendors.html">questions one should pose</a> when engaging prospective consulting firms for information architecture and information management project work. This list of questions should be very valuable if you are on the customer end of a client-vendor relationship. </p>
<p>It also seems like it would be an interesting list of questions to think about if you're a consultant and have never been on the customer end. As a consultant, you probably already ask many of these questions of prospective clients as well, as part of your first client interview about a new project. If you're on that end, this gives an idea of the kinds of things to be prepared to answer. </p>
