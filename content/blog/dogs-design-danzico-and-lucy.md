Below is her summary of what dogs can teach us about interaction design.</p>

<p><strong>1. It's important to know who is in charge.</strong> Just like training a pet, a designer need to establish a rapport with clients that mixes trust and expertise.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Pay attention to the tail.</strong> A dog's tail communicates emotions silently, but it's easy to miss this detail if you are not paying attention. Interaction designers need to be aware of customer data for clues.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Keep gestures simple.</strong> Complicated hand gesture confuses a dog, and complicated language confuses users. Simplicity is best.</p>

<p>Good advice for communicating with humans and dogs alike. <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/featured_items/dogs_on_design_danzicos_obedient_vizsla__16733.asp">Read more on Core77</a>.</p>
