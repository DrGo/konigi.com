  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/change-og-group-keys-2.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>Here's a tip that I blurted out on Twitter in a moment of frustration. I use both Adobe Illustrator and OmniGraffle, and one thing that repeatedly trips me up is using the keyboard shortcuts for grouping/ungrouping between the two apps. Illustrator uses Cmd-G to group, and OmniGraffle uses Shift-Cmd-G. They add the Shift key because CMD-G is assigned to search again which I don't use all that often.</p>
<p>The fix for this, as well as for any Mac application is simple. </p>
<p>1) Open System Preferences > Keyboard and Mouse settings. </p>
<p>2) Select Keyboard Shortcuts in the control bar. Now scroll down to Application Keyboard Shortcuts.</p>
<p>3) Click the Add button and you'll see the dialog above to add keyboard shortcuts. I've shown you how to re-assign the Group command. </p>
<p>4) Now re-assign the commands for UnGroup and Find as above or using whatever seems intuitive to you.</p>
<p>Now you won't need to know you OG from your AI keyboard shortcuts.</p>
