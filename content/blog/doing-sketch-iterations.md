  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/sketch-iterations.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>These are just more illustrations of the process I've been using for design iterations. When I have the Konigi notebook available, I'll be doing some screencasts to describe this process in detail, and why I felt the need to make these graph paper notebooks and pads.</p>
<p>What you see above:</p>
<p>1) Annotated UI Spec (Wireframes) after design review.</p>
<p>2) Sketches for design and new ideas, on the Konigi Design Notebook.</p>
<p>3) Refined sketches, inked and annotated on Konigi Wireframe Graph Paper.</p>
<p>4) The Pentax DSmobile 600 scanner I use to scan and post the sketches to our site for further discussion of design iterations and new ideas.</p>
