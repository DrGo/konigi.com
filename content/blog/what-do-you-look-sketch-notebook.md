  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/wirebinder.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>It's getting kind of old skool over here in the home office. I haven't yet gotten around to talking about why I'm spending time on notepads and notebooks, and just how I use these things. But I'm going to post an article describing just that. This photo is just a teaser to let you know that I'm still working away at this sketch paper stuff because it's an itch that just won't go away.</p>
<p>That big old looking machine you see is a wire ring binder. I've been going through various needs I have for notebooks. I can't live without my Moleskine or Rhodia. One of them goes with me everywhere. Lately it's a Moleskine softcover plain notebook for my sketches, and a small cahier for my todo lists. These are great, but I still want a better notebook just for sketching user interfaces and interaction.</p>
<p>There are a few things I look for:</p>
<p>1) It lays flat and cover can fold over<br />
2) Is small and portable<br />
3) Has some tooth<br />
4) Has a sturdy cover<br />
5) Has perforations for removable pages<br />
6) Has a good graph paper design  </p>
<p>I'd be interested in hearing what other people look for.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm mainly concerned with creating the tool that's most useful for the type of work I do. Sometimes a blank canvas is better. Sometimes a grid is better. Some people will always only want blank paper. But maybe there are others out there, like me, who are looking for something a little better. I spent some days trying and being frustrated with what's out there. Most of the time I'm happy with what I have, but other days I just want nicer grids.</p>
<p>I'm just working on finding the right tools to make my life easier. But I'd love to hear if there are things you look for in a designer's sketch book that you just can find right now. I've been thinking that what might come out of this process for me are a small collection of customizable notebooks that I'll produce for fellow designers with various papers that they select and configure. I don't foresee producing a lot of these now.</p>
