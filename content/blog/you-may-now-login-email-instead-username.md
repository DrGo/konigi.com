<p>Thanks to @lorenbaxter's suggestion, I've enabled logging in with email rather than username if you prefer. Luckily Drupal's <a href="http://drupal.org/project/logintoboggan">logintoboggan</a> module allows admins to offer this option, as well as offering registration and signup without the roundtrip to email. Sweet. Thanks for making my life easier, Drupal.</p>
<p>This should help ease the experience of finding your file downloads as well if you bought stencils or icons form the store. It also brings me around to re-implementing  some of the features I put in in Feb-March last year and then took out, e.g. vote to promote on design and interface submissions. I have a minor redesign planned that hopes to bring that back, but will bring it back for signed in users.</p>
