As an undergrad in the early 90's, I was friends with an art dealer I worked with for a few years who read this magazine. He used to let me borrow his clothes, and the thing I took most of the time was his The Face t-shirt that I'd wear with a black jacket. This set of photos brings back funny memories of that NYC gallery scene. </p>
