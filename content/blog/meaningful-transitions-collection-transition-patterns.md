Johannes wrote his Thesis on &quot;Transitions in the User Interface,&quot; in which he analyzed how motion in the user interface can be a helpful extension to static elements to enhance the user experience.</p>

<p>The collection of transitions is clustered into 6 different categories: Orientation, Spatial Extension, Awaking Controls (Awakening?), Highlight, Feedback, and Feedforward. His description of the effectiveness of each transition forms a pattern-like-library for motion in interface design. Each transition provides a short summary and abstract animation on the category overview. Be sure to click each item to view a detailed view that provides a description of the transition, explanation of when it can be useful, and a description of the benefits for using that transition as a design solution. Several items also provide a real-world example of the solution in use.</p>

<p>Excellent stuff, and impressive execution. <a href="http://www.ui-transitions.com/">Check it out.</a> The thesis is also available in a downloadable <a href="http://www.johannes-tonollo.com/mixed/Meaningful_Transitions_short.pdf">PDF in German</a>.</p>
