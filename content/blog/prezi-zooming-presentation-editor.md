  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://prezi.com/"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/prezi.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p><a href="http://prezi.com/">Prezi</a> is an interesting web app that allows users to create Flash-based Zoomable/Pannable presentations. The interface brings up a presentation editor with a keyboard command, and displays a radial menu for placing media objects, drawing paths for prev/next animation, etc. The finished presentation allows users to step through the "slides" as the canvas zooms and pans. It really might be a nice service for doing things like simple product screencasts, for instance, and hopefully the finished product will allow you to export your work for embedding on your site.</p>
