<blockquote><p>We think JavaScript is awesome. We also think browsers are awesome. Indeed, when we talk about them, we say they are the cat's meow – which is an American expression meaning AWESOME.</p>
<p>In light of these deeply held beliefs, we created this site to showcase cool experiments for both JavaScript and web browsers.</p>
<p>These experiments were created by designers and programmers from around the world. Their work is making the web faster, more fun, and more open – the same spirit in which we built Google Chrome.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some pretty slick stuff in there. Check it out. You won't need Chrome to play with these experiments.</p>
