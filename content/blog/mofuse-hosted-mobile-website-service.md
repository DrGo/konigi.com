<p><a href="http://www.mofuse.com/">MoFuse</a> is a service that allows site owners to provide a .mobi experience for their existing sites. The service allows you simply plug an RSS feed url into your account settings for a new site, and delivers a mobile formatted version of that feed. They also provide the ability to publish as an iPhone app, using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iui/">IUI interface</a>, which you can experience on Google and FaceBook mobile sites. The service also allows you to create static pages, and customize the colors of the UI.</p>
<p>The demo below shows the Konigi feed implemented as a mofuse site. I haven't gotten around to doing feeds that provide screenshots, so you'll see only text for content.</p>

<p>The free service allows publishing under the mofuse .mobi domain, e.g. our Konigi demo is at <a href="http://konigi.mofuse.mobi/">konigi.mofuse.mobi</a>, and includes analytics tools. You can also monetize your site using AdMob or Google Adsense&#8212;you'll do a 50% revenue share with MoFuse. For $6 USD, you can upgrade your account to use your own domain, provide a header logo, and get 100% of your ad revenue.</p>
<p>The functionality you provide is fairly limited, but this can be a nice simple implementation of the IUI experience for sites that don't want to invest the time in creating a mobile format for their sites. </p>
