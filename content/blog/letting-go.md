<blockquote><p>"Issuing your customers with something that is rough, incomplete, and possibly even substandard seems counterintuitive but there is growing evidence that people don't necessarily want the perfect product. They prefer to deal with something ragged around the edges that they can adapt or improve."<br />

<blockquote><p>"The best designs will set the stage, but stop short of fully defining the experience."<br />
