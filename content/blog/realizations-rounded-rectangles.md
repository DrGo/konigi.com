He gets Professor Jürg Nänni, author of <em><a href="http://www.blelb.com/english/blelbpub/publications_en.htm">Visual Perception</a></em> to offer his opinion.</p>
<blockquote><p>A rectangle with sharp edges takes indeed a little bit more cognitive visible effort than for example an ellipse of the same size. Our “fovea-eye” is even faster in recording a circle. Edges involve additional neuronal image tools. The process is therefore slowed down.”</p>
<p>Professor Nänni is saying that rounded rectangles are literally easier on the eye. Put another way, compared to square-edged rectangles, rounded rectangles are more computationally efficient for the human brain. To me, this is a revelation. An idea that at the very least demands more investigation.</p></blockquote>
<p>The comment by Voideka provides a perfect visual reading of the difference between the rounded and sharp angled shapes.</p>
<blockquote><p>"...to me the difference I perceive is a single line versus four lines. In other words, when corners are involved, the brain processes from point A to B, then B to C, and so on, until it completes a circuit. With rounded corners, the line never comes to a point, which we interpret as a stop, and so there is a single computation following the entire shape.</p>
<p>I think the key is in thinking of a point as a full stop (much like a period in a sentence).</p></blockquote>
<p>The point being made is that a particular use of shape, color, position, and movement are not simply aesthetic decisions, but can impact visual cognition. Mullet Sano's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0133033899">Designing Visual Interfaces</a></em> is another good source for the kinds of principles that can be used in practice. I haven't read Nänni's book, but have read a lot of literature on visual literacy, and tend to like the argument, however subtle, about the impact of the rounded shape on effort and perception.</p>
