<blockquote><p>If you’re doing design &amp; user experience work in an open source community, then chances are we have a lot in common – no matter what community we’re working in. We have some big challenges every day, but we also know that if we can overcome those challenges we can make a really big contribution to the sustainability and increased popularity of open source software.</p>
<p>The purpose of this site is to create a space where we can come together to share our experiences, to ask each other questions, to compare notes and to promote the projects we’re working on and help get some extra eyes on our work – and to act as a support network.</p></blockquote>
<p>I like the initial discussion Leisa started about <a href="http://www.designintheopen.org/forum/topics/best-ways-for-uxdesigners-to">how to contribute to Open Source design</a>.</p>
