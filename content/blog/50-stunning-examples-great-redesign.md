<blockquote><p>A redesign can be worth its weight in gold if you get it right. There is a thin line between freshening up your design, and taking a step backwards with a redesign.  Sometimes a redesign can be subtle and simple, and other times it can be a huge re-vamp of a company and itâ€™s goals.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't agree with every redesign in the list, like AT&amp;T, but this is a well thought-out and annotated compilation with some wonderful examples of brand and product transformations. Some are subtle, while others are dramatic. All transform the original in very creative ways.</p>
