<p>So I'm working on this hand drawn font and looking at characters with diacritics is having a weird effect on me. While working on it, the รถ character reminded me of something from my childhood and I had to remake it in type.</p>
<p>So if you can guess what this is by <a href="http://twitter.com/konigi">@ing me on Twitter</a> or in G+ if we follow each other there, I'll give you a floppy disk notebook from my stash, and a few sketch pads.  Game on. Happy Friday.</p>
<h4>Update:</h4>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dakotareese/status/91943430346903553">@dakotareese</a> came closest within minutes, then <a href="https://twitter.com/emenel/status/91952565637488641">@emenel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sjaa/status/91950851249283073">@sjaa</a> guessed it. </p>
<p>The inspiration was the <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Martians">Martians, aka Yip Yips</a>, from Sesame Street:</p>

<p>I don't know how he got so close with just nothing but those 3 letters to go by, but @dakotaresse wins the prize if he wants it. And if you're curious, it's Futura in the middle flanked by Gill Sans.</p>
