<blockquote><p>Los Angeles based social network MySpace, which has 115 million monthly visitors worldwide (Comscore, April 2008), will be launching a redesign of its site next week. The first phase of the project, internally called “MySpace 2.0,” will launch on Wednesday June 18.</p>
<p>The changes affect five major areas of the service: homepage, navigation, profile editor, search and the MySpaceTV Flash player.</p></blockquote>
<p>Search looks very much improved, as does the home page. The profile theme editor also looks much easier to use.</p>
