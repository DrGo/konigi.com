It's full of references and examples debunking stuff we hear repeated enough times that they begin to go unquestioned.</p>
<p>The top 10 UX myth list:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Design Has to be Original</li>
<li>People Read</li>
<li>People Know What They Like</li>
<li>Design Always with Implementation in Mind</li>
<li>Can’t Decide? Make it a Preference</li>
<li>If you Have Great Search, You Don’t Need Great Information Architecture</li>
<li>UX Design Stops at the Edges of the Product</li>
<li>Design to Avoid Clicks</li>
<li>People Don’t Change</li>
<li>If the Design is a Good One, You Don’t Need to Test It</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of these become so ingrained, that it takes a lot of effort to convince clients or colleagues otherwise. I've struggled with many of these beliefs, holdig on to some of the earlier in my career, e.g. I remember heated debates about and broad versus deep and the number of click to get to destinations. I struggle with #2 people read, and #5 preferences and handling options. Those can be huge challenges when you're looking for ways to simplify existing software.</p>
<p>There are so many nuggets here to be appreciated, and a few observations in UIs that I wasn't aware of. Check it out. If any of the references are new, you'll be surfing off the links for days.</p>
