<p>I blogged about what I thought could possibly make a better stylus recently and thought I'd sketch what I was thinking. The above picture shows how I think you could hack the <a href="http://tenonedesign.com/sketch.php">Pogo Sketch stylus</a> so it will glide a little more smoothly on the iPad screen. The capacitive foam creates a little too much friction to feel natural to me. </p>
<p>I drilled a small hole in the foam and inserted a plastic nib from an old pressure-sensitive screen stylus into the center. I then sawed off the back of the barrel and inserted a metal skewer into the back end to hold the nib in place. </p>
<p>The spring was actually part of the old stylus nib, and actually works well for adjusting the pressure when drawing--pressing hard makes the nib recede and the foam makes more contact.</p>
<p>The photo below shows what I ended up with. </p>

<p>Seems like a simple way to get past the problem of drag on the screen. </p>
