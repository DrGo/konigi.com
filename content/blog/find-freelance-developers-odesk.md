If you're like me, you might be itching to get some of those ideas out into the world. <a href="http://www.odesk.com/w/">oDesk</a> is a resource for finding and tracking freelance developers to work on your project. </p>
<p>If you want to get your sketches into the hands of someone who will make it real, this might be a useful resource. I haven't used this service or any others like it in the past, so I'd be interested in hearing if others have an opinion of oDesk or know of other freelance development sourcing sites.</p>
