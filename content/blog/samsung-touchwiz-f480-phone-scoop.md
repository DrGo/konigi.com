<p><a href="http://www.phonescoop.com/articles/article.php?a=182&amp;p=186">PhoneScoop provides a demonstration</a> and photos of the new Samsung TouchWiz finger touch user interface, a 2.0 version of the company's Croix OS. </p>
<p>This one of the first phones to rush to market in order to compete with the iPhone. There doesn't appear to be a multi-touch-type interface for two-finger interactions like zooming, but dragging and dropping appears very similar to the iPhone's drag behavior. One of the fun features is a very configurable home page, which provides user-selectable widgets. Very cute.</p>
