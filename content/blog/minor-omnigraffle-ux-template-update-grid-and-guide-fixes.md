<p>I made a minor update to the OmniGraffle UX Template. The grids were screwed up in the last update I made, so snapping wasn't working. Some guides were also pretty sloppy, so I cleaned those up as well to keep things nice and neat.</p>

<p>Thanks to Jayson Elliot for the heads up about the grid snapping problem.</p>
