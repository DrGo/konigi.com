<p>Chuck Green <a href="http://www.ideabook.com/tutorials/1_view/commercial_graphic_design_is_n.html">offers some advice</a> to designers who see a lot of uniformity in look and feel or sameness of style in their graphic design projects. His point is that design is not artistic expression and that designers need to be able to focus their work on solving problems rather than merely layering their point of view and style over their solution. He argues that the ability to devise different approaches to different problems is difficult, but that designers should attempt this while keeping their opinions at bay. </p>
