<p>Sorry for the lull in activity this past few weeks. I'm doing my last days at my current job and getting ready to transition to a new gig in a week.</p>
<p>After the last 2 months with this site, I've assessed some of the functionality I went out with, and am doing some cleanup. I launched with all the blades out and am now pulling them back in to only expose the essentials. The goal will be to simplify the navigation, and let the screenshots take prominence. There will be some reconfiguring of database searches and sort options as well, now that I've found what the typical flow will be for this site. I'm also going to remove the design/interface submission options for now, and may go another direction with regard to that.</p>
<p>Anyway, for now, I've stripped out the graphics and will get a slightly more low-fi design up in the next few weeks.</p>
