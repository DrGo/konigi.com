<p>Sorry for the downtime. Konigi went down for most of the day yesterday because a spike in traffic and number of database requests caused the databases to be taken offline. With our web host's help, we've moved Konigi to a virtual private server, and now we're able to run our own database rather than share database resources and limit the number of requests we can make. These are all good problems, and the growing pains are to be expected I suppose. Again, sorry for the interrupted service. I think i day of downtime to move the server is pretty good, so I'm just happy we're back in business.</p>
