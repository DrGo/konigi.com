  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/creativemornings-arduino.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>At today's excellent <a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/weblog/2008/11/creativemorni-1.html">Creative Mornings</a> on physical computing, <a href="http://10minchat.com/">Zach Klein and Casey Pugh from Vimeo</a> talked about tinkering with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, an open-source electronics prototyping platform. They showed some simple circuit controls using the LEDs and Processing, and then demoed a Daft Punk helmet they created with LEDs, that could then be controlled/drawn on via a Flash UI. Neat stuff.  </p>
<p>Later, I got to talk to Carl, a freelance developer/interaction designer who turned me onto <a href="http://www.nycresistor.com/">NYC Resistor</a>. NYC Resistor is a hacker collective with a shared space located in downtown Brooklyn where people meet regularly to share knowledge, and hack on projects together.</p>
<p>As a maker, I've been really interested in doing more to combine my craft hobbies with my techie and interface design interests. Resistor sounds like the kind of place I'd be able to do that, and I agree that more web people should play around in this area. Reminds me of some of the 1990's fusion of art/tech in NYC, ala adaweb, JODI, and Eyebeam.</p>
<p>Resistor sounds pretty cool. I've been looking for a reason to play with Processing, and looks like some Processing workshops are going on at the space. </p>
