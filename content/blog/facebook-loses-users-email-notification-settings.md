<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the settings that control which email notifications get sent to you were lost. We're sorry for the inconvenience.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow. Really? I agree with <a href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2008/11/dear-facebook-you-lost-my-what.html">what M. David Peterson</a> had to say about the issue. Sounds like they've got some inexperienced engineers running the show. </p>
<p>If this had been a web service with critical data that wasn't backed up, people would be pretty pissed. When I went to check my email notifications settings, however, everything seemed to be intact. What gives?</p>
