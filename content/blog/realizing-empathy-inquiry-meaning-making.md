<p>Seung Chan Lim, better known as Slim, spent 10 years making software, working in computer science and interaction design at MAYA Design where he was the Assistant Director of Engineering. After some soul searching he began to ask why he was doing what he was doing, and at the suggestion of a mentor, he went out to do something different, something he didn't understand. He went to art school.</p>
<p>Slim's book explores how making works (as a process), what it means (to make something), and why it matters (to our lives). Through this exploration the book also investigates the ethics of our relationship to Computer Technology, and proposes a new direction.</p>
<p>I love the idea of learning something new and unfamiliar as a way of expanding one's perspective. Two of my favorite articles/talks in recent years that relate to this topic are <a href="bill-buxton-how-keep-innovating.html">Bill Buxton's article on how to keep innovating</a> and <a href="paula-scher-gets-serious-ted.html">Paula Scher's Ted Talk on finding fun in the unfamiliar.</a></p>
<p>Judging by the introduction video, the book looks to be substantial, exploratory, humble, and inspiring. I'm really looking forward to reading it. </p>
<p>The book is being funded now, so if you want to see it happen like I do, you can <a href="http://kck.st/whvn03">back this project on Kickstarter</a>. </p>
