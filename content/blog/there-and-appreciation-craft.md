<p>With the glut of anti-craft sentiment I hear and read so often, I think it fitting to post an entry about the love of one's work, drawing from a  craft outside of our own.</p>
<p><em>UP THERE</em> is a beautiful documentary about the slow, laborious, and fading craft of hand-painted advertising murals. This is the NY I love. This is the type of appreciation of craft that I admire.</p>

<p>I feel like the humble young man towards the end that looks at it this way. The learning comes slow, but he's in it for the long haul and knows that the learning is a process of apprenticeship. One day he hopes to be able to teach someone else and give back. There's a respect there that I admire, for his craft, and for those that help him to acquire the skills. </p>
