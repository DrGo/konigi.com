<p>Code.org now has an <a href="http://code.org/educate/k5">elementary school program</a> (Kindergarden - 5th grade), and Code Studio for the program looks like its modeled after the free <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">MIT Scratch app</a>, a visual tool that we used with our first son to introduce computer science fundamentals a few years ago. Good stuff.</p>
