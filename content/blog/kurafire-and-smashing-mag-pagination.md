<p>Faruk Ateş provides some <a href="http://kurafire.net/log/archive/2007/06/22/pagination-101">suggestions for implementing pagination</a>, all of which I would agree with. After the suggestion list, Ateş shows quite a few examples and discusses what's good and bad about them. There's a huge list of examples <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/11/16/pagination-gallery-examples-and-good-practices/">on Smashing Magazine</a> as well, although some of them are a little fussy.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, while a few of the examples show the method of using an ellipsis plus the last few page numbers as a way to show number of pages, Ateş doesn't count that as a recommended practice. </p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of Flickr using this method. I like Flickr's as an example because it's as straightforward as ou can get with no fuss. </p>
<div class="notebook-image"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/konigi/interface/flickr-pagination-2.png" /></div>
<p>The practice of showing the an ellipsis plus the end pages is one of the pagination conventions I've been using for years and is one I'd add as a more explicit recommendation to the lists above.</p>
