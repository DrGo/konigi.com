In some cases, sites bypass signup altogether, and in others, users are permitted to register once they've decided to go beyond simply "testing out" a site or application. As noted, the process of "getting your feet wet by trying," most likely leads to more sign ups because of the frictionless experience.</p>
<p>The article includes a collection of examples including <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> and <a href="http://drop.io/">Drop.io</a>. I personally like Soup.io's process as well and might include it among the good examples here. <a href="http://webjackalope.com/lazy-registration/">Check out all of the examples</a>. </p>
