For Balsamiq users or anyone that bemoans handwritten fonts and sketchy wireframes, I wrote an article to show how to <a href="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/ux/2015/06/15/creating-polished-wireframes/">create polished wireframes in Balsamiq</a> on our UX blog. It shows how to use the wireframe skin with a few base controls, and techniques to achieve a minimalist aesthetic. It's meant for those who need to create client-ready deliverables, or for when the sketchy-skin gets in the way of communicating your ideas. You can keep generating screens fast, but polish the details when you need to.
