<p>His final assessment is below:</p>
<blockquote><p>1) Low fidelity mockups for idea exploration and communication:  Balsamiq<br />
2) Interactive prototypes to test and communicate interactions: Adobe Flex (Thermo may change my mind)<br />
3) High fidelity drawing tool: Adobe Illustrator or OmniGraffle</p></blockquote>
