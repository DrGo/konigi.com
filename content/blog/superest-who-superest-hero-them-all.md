<blockquote><p>The Superest is a continually running game of My Team, Your Team. The rules are simple:</p>
<p>Player 1 draws a character with a power. Player 2 then draws a character whose power cancels the power of that previous character. Repeat.</p></blockquote>
<p>To experience the fun in order, <a href="http://thesuperest.com/archives/2007/10/16/k01_unopposinator/">start at the first hero</a>.</p>
