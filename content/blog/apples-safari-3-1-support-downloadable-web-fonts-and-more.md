<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/02/07/apples_safari_3_1_to_support_downloadable_web_fonts_more.html">Apple Insider reports</a> that Apple will ship Safari 3.1 with downloadable web fonts, HTML5's SQL storage application programming interface, and HTML5 video and audio tags. They provide the following description of these new features.</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, CSS Transforms and CSS Animations will join web downloadable fonts in allowing Safari 3.1 and iPhone users to render web pages and web apps with enhanced design messages and real-time visual effects. By applying Transforms, developers can author trigger actions that scale, rotate, skew and translate HTML boxes in real time. Similarly, Animations offer a quicker route to AJAX-like effects, such as fading out an HTML element, or increasing the border of a box when hovered over.</p>
<p>HTML5's SQL storage application programming interface (API), which is a client-side database storage programming interface that will allow a future array of web applications to store structured data locally on a user's machine using SQL.</p>
<p>Also on tap for the new version of the Apple browser is support for video and audio tags as outlined in the draft specification of HTML5, which add native support for embedding video and audio content in web pages.</p></blockquote>
