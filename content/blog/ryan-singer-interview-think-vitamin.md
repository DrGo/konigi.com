I like that Singer suggests that designers read more about writing copy, but even more so, I like how he suggests that designers should also consider learning more about front end development and programming frameworks. At the very least, it allows designers to be conversant with developers, and ideally it gives a designer a new range of skills they can use for such things as prototyping or doing proof of concept work on their own. Excellent advice for growing the <a href="http://instone.org/tshapedpeople">T-Shaped designer</a>. </p>
