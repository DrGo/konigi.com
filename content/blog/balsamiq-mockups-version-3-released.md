<p>We <a href="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/2015/03/10/b3/">released version 3 of Balsamiq Mockups today</a>! There's plenty to see including an updated interface, new file format (single packaged project files), better asset and symbols management, the addition of <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">FontAwesome</a> icons, and plenty of improvements under the surface. We point out some of the highlights in the video below.</p>

<p>There's plenty more under the hood, and lots of new stuff on deck. You can <a href="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/2015/03/10/b3/">read all about it in the announcement</a>. It's a free update to existing users. <a href="http://balsamiq.com/download/">Download it here.</a></p>
<p>Special thanks to all of the great customers giving us feedback over the years, and particularly those who we talked to in our forum, in our Beta group, our usability test sessions, and in the hallways at Interaction 15 this year. Much more to come!</p>
