They've created an <a href="http://www.uistencils.com/products/ipad-dry-erase-white-board">iPad dry erase board</a> with dot grid, and updated their awesome <a href="http://www.uistencils.com/products/iphone-sticky-pad">iPhone sticky pads</a>. Definitely want to get my hands on the dry erase board.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong><br />
Mine arrived and I have to say that this is the nicest dry erase board I have now. It's made on hard particle board, similar to what you'd find on a clipboard, so it feels great in the hands. There's an interaction key laminated to the back with gesture symbols and common icons, to help you while you sketch. It comes with 2 fine point dry erase markers with eraser heads that work well.</p>

<p>I'm loving it, and so is my son, who plans to use it for stop motion animations. I'm not working on iPad design right now, so I'd love to have a few screen and browser dry erase boards, or a 6-up/8-up sketchboard for thumbnail sketches and storyboards.</p>
