<blockquote><p>The Feast Conference gathers the world's greatest innovators from across industries and society to empower, inspire and engage each other in creating world-shaking change. A creative look at the world's toughest problems, The Feast Conference presents the most innovative solutions, insights, and best practices as a catalyst toward action.</p>
<p>More than a conference, The Feast represents a bottom-up movement, so we're curating an audience as cross-disciplinary and diverse as our talks. But we're doing something a little different -- we ask those who can afford to pay higher prices to micro-sponsor The Feast, which allows us to offer $99 invitations to awe-inspiring vanguards whose brains get them where their wallets can't.</p>
<p>Bottom-up innovation, unparalleled connections and real exchange -- that's something we can sink our teeth into. Join us and get full on good.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of my friends and colleagues know that over the years I've talked about and have been looking for productive ways to fuse my interests in creativity and education/learning with my interests in activism, and the need to live with compassion and empathy. Increasingly, I also want to bring my knowledge and skillset as a web designer into this amorphous mass of desire and need to contribute more positively to society and improve the human condition. I haven't been to an event that fuses the creativity and activism before, so I'm hoping to get inspired and make connections there.</p>
<p>I've alluded to my interest in doing something like this in whatever small way I can via Konigi, but that plan hasn't manifested yet. I'm hoping to meet some like-minded people at this event, and elsewhere in whatever way I can. If you're like-minded in this sense, and feel a similar pull, I'm always willing to chat over coffee in the NYC area. <a href="../contact.html">I can be reached here</a>.</p>
