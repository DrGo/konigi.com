<p>I can't imagine email ever being the right way to critique design, or give feedback as a client, but nevertheless it happens, and Julius Tarng, who works on the Branch app, came up with some <a href="https://medium.com/building-potluck/be7ebb17deff">good advice</a> for those about to give email, and those about to receive it. I think the advice applies for any feedback that's not face to face to face including chat and in comments.</p>

<p><ol><br />
<li>Get on the the same page</li><br />
<li>Talk about what you felt, not what you think the user will feel</li><br />
<li>Use past tense, not present</li><br />
<li>Question constructively by asking for opinions, not challenging them to convince you</li><br />
<li>Try to be specific, and avoid subjective words</li><br />
<li>Donâ€™t be dramatic</li><br />
<li>Give the design some time, and ask yourself if that email needs to be sent now</li><br />
</ol></p>
