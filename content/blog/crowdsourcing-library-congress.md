<p>The Library of Congress has maded 2 of its collections of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/Library_of_Congress">historical photographs available on Flickr</a>. The goal is to get users to tag and comment on the photos, as well as help provide identifying information. </p>
<p>It's very interesting to see such a large and old institution embracing open social collaboration like this. When I was in school, the idea of user supplied freetagging was pretty seen as an edge-case activity even for things like private databases. This openness and the use of a site as simple flickr for the task of implies that crowdsourcing on the web is really beginning to become an accepted mainstream activity. Exciting stuff. I applaud the willingness of the LOC to experiment with social software.</p>
