The page format is similar to popurls, and is intended for people who are too busy to set themselves up with their own RSS reader, or just fancy a quick glance at the latest UX news. The page is curated by Harry Brignull, creator of <a href="http://www.90percentofeverything.com/">90 percent of everything</a>. Feeds are refreshed once every 24 hours.</p>
