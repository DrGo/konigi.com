<p>TechCrunch has some <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/22/a-peak-inside-googles-usability-lab/">photos of a usability lab used by the Gmail team</a> at Google. Some of the photos include earlier iterations of Google Chat that were being tested in the lab.</p>
<p>I only see shots of the observers' room in the photos, but there's some description of their testing room as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>Itâ€™s a small room with a large flat screen monitor, along with a desk and computer. It also has a number of discrete cameras (and a microphone) that keep an eye on the user herself as well as the screen.</p>
<p>Around the corner is a second room where Google employees can watch people interact with the software real time. The room has a couch and a chair along with two screens and speakers to monitor the lab. See the image to the right.</p></blockquote>
