  <p class="dek"><span class="t14">Telling yourself, “Oh, you have all the time in the world, you have all the money in the world, you have all the colors in the palette you want, anything you want,” I mean, that just kills creativity.</span><br />&#8212;Jack White</p>
<p>I was going through the parts I had highlighted in my Kindle version of Austin Kleon's book, <em><a href="http://www.austinkleon.com/steal/">Steal Like An Artist,</a></em> and I keep thinking of how much I like this quote from musician Jack White, talking about using constraints to stay creative. I think about how much constraints and removal of the unnecessary makes a difference in helping flow in the tools I use as well. </p>
<p>The quote was actually taken from an interview of White that you can watch in the documentary <em>Under Great White Northern Lights</em>. There's an extended except in the Makin' Ads blog <a href="http://makinads.blogspot.com/2010/04/jack-white-on-creativity.html">here</a>, or <a href="http://youtu.be/fDl-if5Du70?t=1m26s">watch a video clip on YouTube here</a>. </p>
