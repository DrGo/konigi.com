The lengthy article discusses the process of designing Creatica Inspire and includes links to <a href="http://superpreviewer.com/inspire/">HTML mockups</a> for the new site, and for illustration purposes shows the evolution of PSDtuts, which will also come in line with the new Creatica family of sites. Great read for anyone considering redesigning an existing site with an established set of users, especially with regard to improving funcitonalities, IXD and IA, without upsetting users.</p>
