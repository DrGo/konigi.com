Bowman came onto Google as their first Visual Designer 3 years ago, and left in March. Some quotes from the article:</p>
<p>Bowman on Google:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Data eventually becomes a crutch for every decision, paralyzing the company and preventing it from making any daring design decisions,”</p></blockquote>
<p>Bowman on Twitter, where he is now Creative Director:</p>
<blockquote><p>He has also found a new way to listen to customers: reading their tweets in reaction to the new design features.</p>
<p>“Using data is fundamental to what we do,” Mr. Bowman said. “But we take all that with a grain of salt. Anytime you make design changes, the most vocal people are the ones who dislike what you’ve done. We don’t just throw the numbers in a spreadsheet.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Deborah Dunn, associate professor at the Stanford Institute of Design:</p>
<blockquote><p>Adhering too rigidly to a design philosophy guided by “Web analytics,” Ms. Dunn said, “makes it very difficult to take bold leaps.”</p>
<p>“It is more from engaging with users, watching what they do, understanding their pain points, that you get big leaps in design,” Ms. Dunn said.</p></blockquote>
