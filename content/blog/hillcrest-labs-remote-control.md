  <p class="dek">Hillcrest Labs</a> provides a vision of the pointing and navigating future with their demonstration of Freespace motion-controlled TV remote.</p>

<p>I came across the video demos of Hillcrest Labs' remote control via <a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/06/24/hillcrest-remote-flick-wrist-to-flip-channels/">NewTeevee</a>. The video above shows a demo at the Consumer Electronics Show last winter, but check the <a href="http://newteevee.com/2008/06/24/hillcrest-remote-flick-wrist-to-flip-channels/">NewTeevee</a> link for the more complete demo of their Freespace motion control technology (sadly they won't let me embed it here). The demo shows a proof of concept software interface for the TV that allows the user to navigate and access media on their TV/Computer using the "Loop" concept remote control. </p>
<p>The prototype TV interface shows the flexibility and scalability of navigation that is possible with a motion controlled remote pointing device equipped with scroll wheel and selection buttons. The software they demo is a zoomable user interface (ZUI) that was created to demonstrate the possibility for navigating a media space on the TV. The remote provides tremor control, so panning motions with the remote don't produce the jiggle you see on the Wiimote.</p>
<p>This demonstrates the great potential and possibilities that ZUIs provide for a simple hierarchical interface like this. Other options could have been explored, but the ZUI provides a very intuitive experience using pointing rather than an up/down/left/right control for navigation, e.g. in your TiVo and Apple TV remotes. </p>
<p>The technology will be licensed to consumer electronics companies, so we might hopefully see this navigation paradigm on set top boxes in the future.</p>
