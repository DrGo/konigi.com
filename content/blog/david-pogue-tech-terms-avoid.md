<p>David Pogue offers some suggestions the selection of non-jargony words when writing/speaking about technology. Most of these I agree with. Here's a few: </p>
<blockquote><p>* Enable. Who on earth says, "Enable the GPS function"? Only user-manual writers and computer-book authors. Say "Turn on GPS" instead.</p>
<p>* Support. I don't mean "support" as in "tech support," although even that term is a corporate creepy cop-out (it means "help line"). No, I mean the verb, as in, "The laptop supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth."</p>
<p>In no other corner of modern discourse is "support" used that way. I use "has," "offers" or "works with.</p></blockquote>
