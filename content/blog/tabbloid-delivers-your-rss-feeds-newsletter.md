  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.tabbloid.com/"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/tabbloid.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p><a href="http://www.tabbloid.com/">Tabbloid</a> sat in my tabs for a little while, because really, how interesting can yet another RSS reader be? But now that I've tried it, I have to say that I'm pretty happy with the idea of having this pushed to me for those times when I'd rather read blog updates without my Google Reader. Tablloid turns your feeds into a cleanly designed personal magazine, and delivers a PDF to you, with links intact, at an interval you set. There's no sign up, and the service is free.</p>
