  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://code.google.com/p/emastic/"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/emastic-css-framework.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/emastic/">emastic</a> is an interesting looking CSS Framework that is designed for both fixed and fluid layout. It looks like a nice alternative to fluid layouts than YUI Grids, with simpler and more flexible column structuring and class naming.</p>
<blockquote><p>* Lightweight (compressed weight less then 4kb)<br />
* Personalized width of the page in (em,px,%)<br />
* Use of fixed and fluid columns in the grid.<br />
* Elastic Layout with "em"s </p></blockquote>
<p>Blueprint is going to have to catch up and produce a version for fluid layouts.</p>
