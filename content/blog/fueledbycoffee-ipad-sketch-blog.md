Craighton Berman's <a href="http://fueledbycoffee.tumblr.com/">Fueled by Coffee sketchblog</a> will give you an idea of what sketches can look like using these tools. Ideas is super simple and smoothens your lines so things look naturally drawn.</p>

<p>I'm really loving it. The adjustment is taking time, and it's not as quick as pen and paper, but it's slightly more natural using a <a href="http://tenonedesign.com/sketch.php">Pogo Sketch Stylus</a>.</p>
