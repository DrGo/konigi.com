<p>Adobe have released a special Flash Player to Google and Yahoo! that <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/swf_searchability.html">will allow the search engines to crawl SWFs and index their content</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Adobe is providing optimized Adobe Flash Player technology to Google and Yahoo! to enhance search engine indexing of the Flash file format (SWF) and uncover information that is currently undiscoverable by search engines.</p></blockquote>
<p>This player will apparently behave like user going through a Flash site and index content as it interacts with the site. It's about time.</p>
