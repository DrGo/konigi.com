<p>HTML5 Boilerplate is not a library, but a template and set of awesome examples for how to get started integrating HTML 5 into your sites. They provide techniques for future-proofing HTML/CSS/JS, with cross-browser normalization, performance optimizations, even optional features like cross-domain Ajax and Flash in mind. They also give you a starter apache .htaccess config file with caching rules and prep your site to serve HTML5 video, use @font-face, and use gzip.</p>
