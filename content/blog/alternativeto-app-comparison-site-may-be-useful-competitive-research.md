The new site describes itself as a a way to find better Windows, Mac, Linux and online applications by submitting the app you want to replace. It's a community site that relies on user submissions, so the number of alternatives is limited in some areas. Having a look at the <a href="http://alternativeto.net/desktop/basecamp/">Basecamp alternatives</a>, for instance, only shows MS Project and the RedMine web app when I looked. But more popular app suggestions are abundant, e.g. alternatives to <a href="http://alternativeto.net/SearchResult.aspx?profile=software&amp;search=word">MS Word</a>. </p>
<p>This could be a good resource with time for collecting examples to reference when doing a competitive study for a web app. One to watch.</p>
