<p><a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?756">Luke Wroblewski pointed</a> to Josh Bush's <a href="http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/">Masked Input Plugin</a> for JQuery. Luke writes that the plugin "integrate(s) formatting cues directly into an input field to help signal how to correctly answer a question. These formatting instructions are automatically included in an input and cannot be removed by a user. More importantly, a user cannot enter other non-valid characters into the input field. Check out the demo at Masked Input Plugin."</p>
<p>The video Luke posted to YouTube, and the demo on Bush's site, show how the input mask works. Great example of an elegantly conceived method for error prevention in forms.</p>
