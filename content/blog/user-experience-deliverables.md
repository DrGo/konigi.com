  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000228.php"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/morville-ux-deliverables.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>Peter Morville and Jeffrey Callender have been compiling a <a href="http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000228.php">list of UX deliverables</a> and have summarized 20 of them succintly on the Semantic Studios site.</p>
<blockquote><p>This list describes twenty user experience deliverables with links to relevant resources and examples. Clearly, these artifacts of the process are not the whole story. We must also think about the relationship between goals, methods, and documents. And yet, for many of us, deliverables are the coin of the realm and merit special attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've taken the 20 deliverables and put them into a single, full-sized poster-like image <a href="http://konigi.s3.amazonaws.com/notebook/morville-ux-deliverables-large.png">in PNG</a> or <a href="http://konigi.s3.amazonaws.com/notebook/morville-ux-deliverables-large.pdf">PDF</a> format if you want to view them that way. There's also a cute image that shows the deliverables as a Treasure Map. <a href="http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000228.php">Go read the article</a> for the full 9.</p>
