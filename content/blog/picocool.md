Emily recently launced a new showcase of interesting finds with <a href="http://www.picocool.com/">PicoCool</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>A global community dedicated to uncovering the cool, whether in art, design, environment, culture, architecture, fashion, travel or technology. Our community finds and shares tiny bytes and unique content from the world of peer media, social networks and subcultures. We discover upcoming designs, cool products, micro-trends, subcultures, artists, human experiences, innovations, philosophies, technologies, and more.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the undiscovered and the mundane lives real brilliance. PicoCool is about uncovering these microscopic moments when things first begin.</p></blockquote>
