Remember these? From 2009-2010 I these sketchbooks for a while, using a 5.25" floppy disk as a notebook cover. I kind of missed them, so I made a limited number in blank and grid paper.

It’s a wirebound 5.25 inch square sketchbook with about 120-130 pages (60-65 sheets) of 70 pound white vellum paper, hand-crafted by me in my home North of the SF Bay. You can buy a book with blank sheets or one printed with 1cm grid in warm gray ink. Inside you’ll find a floppy disk pocket, and a disk label. Hope you like them! They're a head turner. :)

Get yours at the shop while they last! Shipping inside the US only this time around. <a href="http://shop.konigi.com">http://shop.konigi.com</a>
