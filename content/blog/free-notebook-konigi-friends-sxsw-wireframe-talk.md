  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="chrome://speeddial/content/speeddial.xul"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/konigi-notebooks-sxsw.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>So I've made some 8.5 in. by 5.25 in. graph paper notebooks because I wanted something a little more functional than what I was using for sketching. They're basically a mini version of the wireframe grid I use, with markers for 1/3s and 1/4s, but without the gutters. I've been working with a prototype of this for a few months now and have a bunch of these ready to put up for sale, but haven't been rushing to do it, mostly because I made them for myself and selling stuff like notebooks isn't profitable until you get into selling large quantities, and unfortunately I haven't the time to market the pads and books.</p>
<p>So I had a great idea for now. I am going to sell these eventually, when other higher priorities get out of the way, but for now, I'm going to start off by giving the first 30 or so away, starting with a little gift for my Konigi readers who happen to be able to make it to SXSW to hear the <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2186">wireframe panel</a> that Nick Finck, Donna Maurer and I are doing. After the talk, if you're one of the first 30 to come up to me and give me the secret word, which I'll announce on Twitter a few days before the talk, you'll get one of the books. My little thank you for being a reader and making it out to the talk.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
