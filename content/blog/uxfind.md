It provides a search engine tailored for User Experience pros. It indexes over 200 of user experience web sites and blogs. Oddly, they index my old blog iaslash, but not Konigi, so I guess the sources might not be so fresh. It's a great idea, and I've tried to do this in the past too, to just limit to sources I trust. To be honest, I always end up casting a larger net, however.</p>
