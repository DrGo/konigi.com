<p>TechSmith has published a useful tutorial that shows <a href="http://video.techsmith.com/morae/2.0/edu/use-rrt-data-searching/default.html">how to view where people clicked during sessions</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Morae recordings use TechSmith’s Rich Recording Technology (RRT) to capture video, audio, camera input, as well as all sorts of data, including keyboard entry, screen text, web page changes, mouse clicks, and system events.  Use Manager’s Search Results pane to help you focus in on this valuable information to support your findings.</p></blockquote>
<p>This feature is pretty hidden, so Morae users will want to check this out.</p>
