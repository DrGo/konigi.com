<p>There's an interesting discussion in UX Matters prompted by a question regarding <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/05/using-verbs-as-nouns-in-user-interfaces-ux-roles-in-organizations.php">the use of verbs as nouns</a>. This wording used in an enterprise context is the example provided, "Click here to view your views." Confusing and awkward. </p>
<p>A dialogue follows with several designers, who seem to agree that understanding the language of the business and context, and using that in the given situation is the right approach. It's a matter of unearthing the terminology, whether through contextual inquiry and exercises like card sorting, and using what's appropriate and familiar in the context, so users can "View sales reports" or what have you rather than viewing [insert meaningless label here].</p>
