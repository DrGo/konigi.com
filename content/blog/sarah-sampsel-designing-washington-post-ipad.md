The <a href="http://www.sarahsampsel.com/blog/2010/11/08/designing-the-washington-post-app-for-ipad/">first entry</a> describes the types of interaction, visual design, and brand issues she had to consider when designing for the device. <a href="http://www.sarahsampsel.com/blog/2010/11/10/designing-the-washington-post-for-ipad-detailed-wireframes/">The second shows a few wireframes</a> of the evolution of the home screen design.</p>

<p>Would have been lovely to also see some of the sketches, but it's awesome that Sarah shared not just final wireframes, but a series of wireframes showing the iterations. I'm hopeful that she'll continue the series to discuss the visual design and some post-launch thoughts.</p>
