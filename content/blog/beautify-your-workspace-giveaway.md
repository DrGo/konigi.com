What better way to keep producing inspiring work than to create an inspiring workspace, surrounded by the clean and modern design of the lighting and desk accessories we've chosen for you.</div>
<h3>Modern Office Gear</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.allmodern.com/">All Modern</a> has a fantastic selection of modern furniture, home d√©cor and lighting from brands like <a href="http://www.allmodern.com/Knoll-%AE-C61166.html">Knoll</a>, Herman Miller, Heller and Blu Dot. I love the look and feel of modern and minimalist designed office furniture and desk accessories, and want to share the love with our readers. So we're giving one lucky winner their choice of one of the following items from the George Kovacs or Jack Georges collections.  Due to shipping costs, the contest is limited to participants from the U.S. only. Apologies to those outside the U.S. </p>
<h3>Desk Lamps</h3>

The Cubic Collection receives its name for its featured cube shaped lamp shade. This contemporary table lamp consists of a slender brushed nickel arm that stands on a base, which complements the shade's shape. The etched cased opal glass shade is the stand-out attribute of this piece.</p>
