Companies or individuals who are looking to name something pay $99 to request help in naming the thing. Participants provide suggestions and vote or invest a stake in the suggestions that have been posted. <a href="http://kluster.com/">Kluster's</a> robots decide which is best, and participants get paid back when they've invested in the winner. You can find out more about <a href="http://namethis.com/name_this/projects/new">how it works</a>.</p>
<p>The UI shows the list of projects posted and a countdown for the time remaining to participate. It's pretty interesting stuff if taken seriously by the participants. I suspect the payoffs will keep things from going sour. </p>
<p>Some of the winners have been good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local Shopping Search Engine = Nearbuy</li>
<li>TechCrunch Elevator Pitches = CrunchTime</li>
</ul>
<p>Others I thought were only so-so. Sadly, I can't find a list to view the archive of all past projects.</p>
<p>Definitely might be worth the price of entry for the creatively challenged.</p>
