<p>I'm honored to have been nominated for the InJo Pick alongside the well respected journalists in this year's selection, and will be attending the <a href="http://ij7.innovationjournalism.org/">InJo 7 conference</a> in Palo Alto, participating in a round table on June 8. I'm certain there will be much for me to learn from the experience and the exposure to the great minds at this event.</p>
