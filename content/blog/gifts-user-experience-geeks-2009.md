<p><blockquote>[I]t is once again time for the gifts for user experience geeks post for the 2009 holiday season.  Just like last year this list is a collection of items I have come across over the last year that would make the ideal gifts for UX geeks like Information Architects, Usability Specialists, Interaction Designers, and even Web Designers.</blockquote></p>
