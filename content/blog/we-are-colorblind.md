Van Beveren discusses good and bad examples of interfaces, charts and diagrams with respect to how they are viewed by color-blind users. He also provides patterns and suggestions for improving their accessibility. </p>
<p>Would be excellent to pass some of the examples through some of the <a href="../tools/submissions/color-deficit-simulators.html">simulators</a> I recommend.</p>
