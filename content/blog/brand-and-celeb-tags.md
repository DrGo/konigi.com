The game can be played in reverse as well, by viewing a tag cloud and trying to guess what the brand or celeb is.</p>
<p>I tried to take screenshots, but the celebrities' tag results were full of nonsensical tags. Someone decided to game the site obviously to fill it with tags that take over the results pages because of the variable font sizing of cloud tags. The brand tags site actually worked better in terms of having better tags. </p>
