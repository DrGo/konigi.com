<p>I'm happy to announce that Konigi will soon be offering several products for creatives. I've posted some photos I took quickly of the first set below. Better photos will come when the shopping cart is set up.</p>
<p>The first round of gear will include wireframe and storyboard notepads. Each of these pads include 50 sheets at 8 1/2 x 11 inches on white 70# paper, glued on the left side. The ink is a non-photo blue (cyan) so that the grid lines and any sketch lines made in non-photo blue pencil can be knocked out when scanned and processed in graphics software. </p>

<p>If you are interested in the details of the scanning process I use with graph paper like this, and are also interested in the issues related to knowledge management during the creative process, I recently posted a relevant response to someone question about this in the Information Architecture Institute members mailing list. Later in the week, I'll do a longer write up about this here on Konigi to talk about why I've been working with scanned sketches, and why I think there's a need for this paper. Stay tuned.</p>
