If you have a Sling Box, you can also now view your sling player in a web browser as well (IE/Windows only for now). I guess the rollout of features will be gradual. Can't wait until Clip N Sling is available for Sling Box owners and more social features are released. We designed a number of very interesting interfaces which don't appear to be available yet.</p>
