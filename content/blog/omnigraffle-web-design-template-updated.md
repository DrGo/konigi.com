<p>I updated the <a href="http://urlgreyhot.com/personal/resources/omnigraffle_web_design_template">OmniGraffle Web Design Template</a>.</p>
<p>This web design template is for people who do wireframes and storyboards. The template was created for OmniGraffle Professional provides the basic layout for a design deliverable including the following master canvases: document title, section title, wireframe (portrait and landscape), storyboard, and blank. The wireframes were created at 950px wide with guides following the Blueprint CSS Grid system. Wireframes also have 2 small hairline marks around the 600px point to mark the approximate fold.
