  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/happy-holidays-from-konigi.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>I just wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who took some time out of their busy days to read Konigi this year, to provide their feedback and commentary, to download my tools, to buy notepads, and to help me keep a dialogue going with you, my new and old design and development friends. This has been a very rewarding first year playing with this blog, and I feel light years away from those years spent doing iaslash.</p>
<p>I wish you all a safe and happy holiday season. I'll be slowing down quite a bit in the next few weeks to spend time with my family, but will return in the next few months with some improvements and surprises on this site. </p>
<p>-Michael</p>
