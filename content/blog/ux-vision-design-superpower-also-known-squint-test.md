It helps you see the whole of your screen and look for anything that stands out, and see what needs to draw more attention, depending on the priority and hierarchy of your page elements. </p>
<p>It's certainly useful for visual designers, but can be just as useful for interface designers. Another thing I do related to this is zoom out and turn my wireframes into visual thumbnails on the screen. </p>
