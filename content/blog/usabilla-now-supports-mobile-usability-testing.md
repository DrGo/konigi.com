They've added <a href="http://blog.usabilla.com/mobile-ux-testing/">mobile testing</a> to their remote, unmoderated testing service.  The new feature lets users participate by using their smartphones or tablets to test the screenshots or urls you specify in each task or scenario.</p>

<p>As with their past offering, participants are stepped through each scenario and asked to respond by adding markers to screens and notes/responses to your questions. I ran test scenarios on both iPhone and iPad, and the interface is clean, and simple, and optimized to work well with both devices. <a href="http://blog.usabilla.com/mobile-ux-testing/">Read more here</a>.</p>
