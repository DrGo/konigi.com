<p><a href="http://www.twittearth.com/">TwittEarth</a> is another spinning earth globe interface for displaying geolocalized information that's similar to the <a href="yahoo-newsglobe-vs-wii-news-channel.html">Yahoo Newsglobe and wii news channel</a> interfaces. </p>
<p>I don't care much for viewing the public twitter feed, so it's not very interesting to me. I'm still trying to imagine the context that makes these interfaces practical for everyday use. The place where it makes most sense to me is in the 10 foot experience, as with the wii news channel. I think applications like this need find more ways of taking that PC information to the big screen for casual information browsing or information delivery in the background, like screensavers for TV.</p>
