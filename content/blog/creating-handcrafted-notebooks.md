  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/my-first-notebook-2.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>This is my first case bound book notebook. I took a one day workshop at the Center for Book Arts to continue pursuing my obsession with notebooks. It is half filled with Bienfang 8x8 to the inch graph paper and the other half is Borden and Riley bleed proof paper. The section of papers is stitched into a text block that is drilled on left side to create this landscape orientation.</p>
