<p>On the Dolores blog, Brendan <a href="http://blog.doloreslabs.com/2008/03/where-does-blue-end-and-red-begin/">explains</a> how Mechanical Turk was used to present a set of random colors to participants in an exercise designed to observe how people name colors. The project was inspired by the <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/wcs/">World Color Survey</a>. </p>
<p>The result was the color explorer, aka "The Amazing Color Label Wheel!" The explorer allows you to enter color words to filter the visualization. The data set has been released so you can do more visualizations on your own.</p>
