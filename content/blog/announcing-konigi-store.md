The first 2 products are graph paper notepads formatted for user interface design and design of time-related sequences.</p>
<p><strong>The Wireframe Graph Paper Notepad</strong> is made for visual designers, interaction designers, and information architects designing for the screen. The notepad has 50 sheets at 8 1/2 x 11 inches on white 70# paper, glued on the left side. The ink is a non-photo blue (cyan) so that the grid lines and any sketch lines made in non-photo blue pencil can be knocked out when scanned and processed in graphics software.</p>
<p><strong>The Storyboard Notepad</strong> is made for creatives who think about interactions over time, whether doing user interface or interaction design or planning video, film, and animation sequences. The notepad has 50 sheets at 8 1/2Ã—11 inches on white 70# paper, glued on the left side. The ink is a non-photo blue (cyan).</p>
<p>You can find out more about these products at <a href="http://shop.konigi.com/?q=store">http://konigi.com/store</a>. Due to several large advanced orders supplies are limited. </p>
