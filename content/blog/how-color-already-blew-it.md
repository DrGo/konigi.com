<p>Mike Rundle writes about getting the first impression right in an application by guiding the first time user. He offers 4 great tips for getting traction on mobile apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delight users with a beautiful look &amp; feel</li>
<li>Take a novel approach to an interesting problem or market niche</li>
<li>Inspire user confidence through user experience consistency and ease-of-use</li>
<li>Guide newcomers around so they can learn and then show others</li>
</ul>
<p>He then goes through the first impression experience with the Color app and talks about what they did wrong, and how they can fix it. <a href="http://flyosity.com/design/how-color-already-blew-it.php">Read more.</a></p>
