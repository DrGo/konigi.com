  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/konigi-sketch-stencils.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>If you've been following this blog, you may know how I've wanted to do sketch/jitter line styles in OmniGraffle to produce sketchy diagrams and wireframes. After David's demo of his method for doing sketch shapes on the Design Commission blog got me started figuring out how to get the effect natively in OG, I've started to finally create sketch versions of the <a href="../tools/omnigraffle-wireframe-stencils.html">Wireframe Stencils</a>. Above is a screenshot of the forms set. I expect this will take me a few days, but hope to release these in a few weeks.</p>
