Jackson Wilkinson's blog about the <a href="http://jounce.net/blog/2009/jan/28/when-sitemaps-dont-work-two-alternatives/">altnernatives to hierarchical sitemaps</a>, and the use of concept maps or user flows as alternatives when hierarchy doesn't work in your documentation. </p>
<p>I have to agree with one point, in that site maps don't always serve documentation well when the notion of a strict hierarchy just doesn't exist. But I think there's utility in sitemaps at conveying the organization of a site or application at some level. It may be a very high level visualization that maps concept model/mental models to navigation or application menus, and provides a way for a team to visualize the connections between what the user sees and what the system represents in UI. </p>
<p>I don't do sitemaps very often anymore, especially when working on application design. They get you far enough in terms of conveying a 1,000 foot view of the landscape, but the meat of the documentation seems to be in uncovering topography. And that can be the stuff of quite a few deliverable types, including user flows, use cases. A nice list of deliverables that might be suitable is in Peter Morvilles' <a href="user-experience-deliverables.html">UX Deliverables run down</a>. </p>
