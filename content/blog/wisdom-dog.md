<p>This is a good bit of advice for kids and adults alike from Jake the Dog. Adventure Time is my son's favorite show, and one of mine as well. I made the print for his birthday, and will put it on of our walls. I like having the reminder every time I feel discouraged when starting something new. </p>
<p>You can see the extended version <a href="http://youtu.be/vrBWJLC22mE">on YouTube</a> and <a href="http://society6.com/MAKE141/Wisdom-from-a-dog">purchase a print at Society6</a>.</p>
