<p>From her about page, she says "...Iâ€™ve been using them in my work, my personal life and as a tool to help companies work faster, more collaboratively, and to make smart decisions that stick. In 2007, I began speaking to groups about these simple, cheap, ubiquitous and powerful tools. This site is a resource for stickynote ninjas everywhere as we journey in our quest for perfection via stickynotes."</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
