+++

I published a free course for Balsamiq users on Skillshare. The course, <a href="http://skl.sh/1MCi9sC">Rapid Wireframing: Finding the Right Product Design</a>, is designed for those new to <a href="http://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq</a>, but also features some demonstration of new features like Quick Draw (using the mouse to block out wireframe zones) and Alternates (creating alternate versions of screens). If you're a veteran user, you may be interested in checking that out, and updating to the <a href="https://balsamiq.com/download/">latest version</a> to take advantage of these useful new ways of working on projects.

Here's a trailer to give you an idea of what to expect.

You'll learn how to successfully create wireframes for early stage product design as I show how to use Balsamiq Mockups to design interfaces with product teams, using the example requirements from <a href="http://www.uxapprentice.com/" target="_blank">UX Apprentice</a>.

In the 51 minute course, you'll see how concept selection can be tackled with low-fidelity wireframes, learn to create rough sketches to explore ideas, and then transform them into interaction design solutions that can be refined quickly, and polished for presentation.

The class is perfect for product managers, developers, and those new to designing with wireframes. <strong>No prior knowledge</strong> or experience with interface design <strong>is required</strong>. By the end, you'll be able to present wireframes for a finished product idea and demonstrate a clickable prototype.
