Will be interesting to see what people come up with. I'd especially like to see the explanation that explains IA in layman's terms in a way that my non-techie mother could understand.</p>

<p><blockquote>What is it? Why is it important? What does it mean to you? Some folks may offer a definition in 140 characters or less, while others will use this opportunity to tell a story (using text, pictures, audio, and/or video) about their relationship to IA. Anyone can enter, but only IA Institute members can vote for the winners.</p>
