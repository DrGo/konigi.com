<p>Brazilian web designer Fabio Sasso provides a tutorial describing how he creates a site in Fireworks. I'm not a Fireworks user, but this blog entry caught my eye because of how instructive and thoroughly illustrated it is. I'm a loyal Photoshop user and don't intend to drop dollars for another graphics program, but the examples here make Fireworks look pretty darned nice.</p>
