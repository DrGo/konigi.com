<blockquote><p>Three 60 x 110mm, 100pp Notepods printed on both sides. 80gsm laser throughout with a stiff black strawboard back.</p>
<p>Front: 52mm by 77mm of blank space floating in darkness. Endless possibilities in a form reminiscent of a popular smart phone.</p>
<p>Back: A light 6mm grid, perfect for notes or jotting down the phone number of a hot geek.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm getting a set, even though I don't typically do iPhone design. <a href="http://notepod.net/">Get yours here</a>.</p>
