The video opens with a UI that displays falling media that appear like little square stamps dropping like leaves to a desktop with contacts, photos, videos, etc. on the face of the leaves. The user can apparently pick up one of the pieces, and if it's a video for example, start playing that video in the UI. Also shows a pretty carousel menu and an awesome looking RGB color mixer for customizing the wallpaper I presume. Very nice ideas here, if only for conceptual purposes.</p>
