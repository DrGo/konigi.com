Great example of designers finding buyers in a market saturated with accessory makers. They stand out because they've thought of the problem, researched how to make the better mousetrap and deliver a product that sells the story of sticking your nano wherever you want when you work out. They've made $50K in 6 months. Excellent stuff.</p>
