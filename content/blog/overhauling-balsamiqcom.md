In addition to doing interface design on the product (myBalsamiq mostly up to now) I also get to be the &quot;webmaster.&quot; :) What that means in our small startup is doing the user research, interface design, visual design, and front end development. If you know me, you know that I dig getting to do more than one thing, so that's a win.</p>

<p>In any case, take a look and see how we evolved our little site. I'm planning to do another article on some the CSS 3 techniques I learned, but this high level blog entry will give you an idea of what I learned doing this project.</p>
