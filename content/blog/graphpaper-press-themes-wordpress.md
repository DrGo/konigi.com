Allender is creating 1 new skin every month in 2008. The first in the series are the <a href="http://graphpaperpress.com/2007/12/09/gridline-lite/">Gridline themes</a>, a pared down, minimal design that comes in three flavors: lite, news, and magazine. Any of these should provide a barebones framework for a small business looking to use WordPress to get their site up and running quickly. From the base stylesheet you can tweak CSS to suit your brand. </p>
<p>Of course, the danger in using themes like this out of the box is that your site ends up looking like scores of others. Most of these look like <a href="http://subtraction.com/">Subtraction</a> with subtle variations and added content modules, so take the time to customize the theme.</p>
