<p>It divides the stream into 2 panels: private information on top (messages, calendar events) and public information on bottom (stock quotes, news). It provides color-coded category markers, and a draggable menubar that allows the user to selectively change the volume of information between top and bottom lists, and when pushed to a single end, provides focus on that category. A multi-click toggle on the right icon of the menu bar allows you to filter by shuffling through categories. </p>
<p>Nice use of direct manipulation to set volume and filter the feed. To get the full demonstration, <a href="http://larvalabs.com/product_pages/intelligent_home_screen.html">click the video link on the product page</a>.</p>
