<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10037202-1.html?tag=mncol;posts">CNet reports</a> on <a href="http://www.swypeinc.com/">Swype</a>, a new keyboard technology for touch screens created by the inventory of the T9 keyboard technology for numeric keypads. Swype lets the user drag their finger across the screen, touching each of the letters in the words they want to enter, and predictive software selects the word they wanted. This could be a great tool to the improve the typing experience on the iPhone, which I find pretty awful compared to a hardware keyboard. Will also be very useful to the next wave of touch screen notebooks and ultra mobiles that we'll be seeing.</p>
