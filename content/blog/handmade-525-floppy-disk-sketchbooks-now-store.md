It's a hand-made, wirebound 5.25 inch square sketchbook with about 140-150 pages (70-75 sheets) of 70 pound white vellum paper printed with 1cm grids in warm gray ink. The cover is made from a 5.25 inch floppy disk, and inside you'll find a floppy disk pocket, and a disk label and write-protection sticker.</p>
