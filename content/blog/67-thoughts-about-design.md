In his list, he drops some thoughts that simply reflect the era of the present and past 15 years, and in others he provides nuggets of wisdom. Here's a sampling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody's doin' it</li>
<li>Small things are often (usually?) more important than big things.<br />
"It" is about the way every individual conducts himself or herself. (E.g., the hotel housekeeper, restaurant busboy.)</li>
<li>Aesthetics and usability are equally important—with perhaps a slight edge to usability. ("'It won a prize' is the ultimate criticism."—Don Norman</li>
<li>"It" must be on every (literally) agenda; in project reviews of every type "it" must hold its own with, say, the budget discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I only wish "it" was formatted in HTML bullets (unordered links) so it was more readable. :)</p>
