  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.pacemaker.net/default.aspx?documentID=294&amp;entryID=10482"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/pacemaker2.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>Pacemaker, the mobile MP3 DJ device that debuted last year with a 120 GB hard drive, is getting a 2.0 release this spring and offering an additional lower capacity 60 GB hard drive option, and a new user interface. </p>
<p>I was enamored with this device and the way they could incorporate most of the possible mixer and track selection controls for 2 deck track mixing into a single, albeit large, handheld device with their <a href="http://www.pacemaker.net/device/tutorials/">original product</a> UI. The <a href="http://www.pacemaker.net/default.aspx?documentID=294&amp;entryID=10482">newly redesigned UI</a> looks like it made some usability tweaks and subtle improvements. For instance, there's a new scrolling behavior that highlights your alpha headings. Some filtering options look like they'd be welcome improvements as well. For those that actually DJ, there are a bunch of new effects in there too it seems. The hardware remeains the same.</p>
<p>Now the lower price point and an improved UI, I might actually get one of these. It's still pricey, but over the years my use of 1200s, Trakktor, and Torq have diminished to near nothing. I get by now playing with a DS KORG. I miss DJing, but this may be the toy for me.</p>
