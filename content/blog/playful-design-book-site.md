<p><blockquote>Game design is a sibling discipline to software and Web design, but they're siblings that grew up in different houses.  They have much more in common than their perceived distinction typically suggests, and user experience practitioners can realize enormous benefit by exploiting the solutions that games have found to the real problems of design.  This book will show you how. </blockquote></p>

<p>This is a book I can't wait to read. It's to be published in 2011, but as with all Rosenfeld books, we get the benefit of reading about the author's research in-progress beforehand.</p>
