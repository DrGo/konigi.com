<p>I've added screenshots to the feeds finally. This has been on my to do list, but I finally got off my ass and spent a couple hours this morning figuring how to get Drupal to do it after <a href="../design/submissions/artgeex.html">a user made some demands</a>. There are a bunch of things that aren't working for me on this site that I plan to fix, but I went with the idea of getting things up fast versus getting them out right. The experience will get better over time, I promise.  </p>
<p>For the record, I don't plan to implement every suggestion that comes along, but this has been on my list. If you do have suggestions, please do make them, but know that I'm more receptive to a friendly tone.</p>
