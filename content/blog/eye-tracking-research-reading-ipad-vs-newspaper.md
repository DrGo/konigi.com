<p>Miratech observed the difference between reading an article in a newspaper and on an iPad in an eye tracking study. They concluded that readers are more likely to skim over articles on an iPad than in a newspaper.</p>

<p><ul><br />
<li>The type of medium doesn't influence reading time when the text is short (like an article).</li><br />
<li>It is easier to assimilate and retain information read in a newspaper than on an iPad.</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>They plan to write up another white paper presenting their results looking at ad visibility.</p>
