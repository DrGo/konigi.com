  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/omnigraffle-icon-set-coming.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>I've been accumulating a bunch of icons and other miscellaneous controls in my OmniGraffle Wireframe Stencil and think it's about time to separate those into their own stencil set. The icons you see here are some of the ones I plan to include in this new set. </p>
<p>Any others you'd like to see here that aren't already represented? These are the ones I've actually had to use in the past 3 or 4 years.</p>
