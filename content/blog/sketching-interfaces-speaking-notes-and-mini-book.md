<p>I gave a talk at <a href="http://www.asburyagile.com/">Asbury Agile 2012</a> and have published my presentation deck and speaking notes as a zine-like mini book in a new section of this site. My friends on Instagram have seen me teasing out this talk for a few months now, and I'm happy to get the ideas out because this is something I've been thinking about ever since I started this site. </p>
<p>This is the perspective of someone who is starting over and taking the beginners path. <a href="../book/sketch-book.html">Check it out.</a></p>
