  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.dallassthlm.com/playground/playground.html"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/playground-contextual-ad.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>Swedish agency Akestam Holst has created <a href="http://www.dallassthlm.com/playground/playground.html">a contextual banner ad</a> for retailer Playground Stores that selects an appropriate jacket for you depending on the weather where in your location. The demo seems hard coded, but is kind of neat. Would be really weird if they could figure out my gender and favorite colors.</p>
