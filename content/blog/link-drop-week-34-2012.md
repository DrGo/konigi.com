<p>Light drop this week because I was out camping for most of it. Little tidbit about the Link Drop name. I like it because it reminds me of a record <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_drop_(DJing)">needle drop</a>. </p>

Every build and iteration requires review and circling back to evaluate the component in terms of the need identified in the use case scenario. Put into action, he says:<br />
How do we integrate the components back into a context for review? Ask the question: “What is the user trying to do here?” The job the user has in mind is the best integration point because the user’s mind doesn’t tidily follow the boundaries of implementation.</li>

Let's Look At The Evolving Subway Experience | Co.Design: business + innovation + design</a> Robert Fabricant looks at the ways interaction design has had an impact on the MTA/NYC subway system from the Metrocard kiosks and turnstiles, to the signage and app ecosystem that enable better wayfinding and information use in what can be an overwhelmingly complex system to navigate. Also touches on the IXDA awards.</li>

The group meets frequently, literally sitting around a kitchen table, to debate all products under development. “We’ll sit there with our sketch books and trade ideas,” Stringer said, appearing as the first witness in the Apple vs. Samsung trial. “That’s where the really hard, brutal honest criticism comes in.”<br />
From there, the group puts the sketches into a computer-aided design program and, if warranted, creates a physical model. “Our role is to imagine products that don’t exist and guide them to life,” Stringer said. There could be 50 designs for a single button, he added. “We’re a pretty maniacal group of people,” he said."</li>
