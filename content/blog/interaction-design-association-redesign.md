The IXDA has one of the most impressive list archives for professional association that I've ever used, and the new features provided by this platform open up a host of new notification options. There are a few more browsing options in the discussion area, a resource library, and what looks like a redesigned job board.</p>

<p>Excellent work. <a href="http://www.ixda.org/">Check it out</a> if you haven't already.</p>
