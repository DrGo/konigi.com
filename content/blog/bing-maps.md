<p>Microsoft has been doing some interesting work with Bing Maps. The augmented reality demos at the TED conference this week generated some buzz. The photo and video overlays were cool.</p>
<p>"We see this space, three-dimensional environment as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out," says Bing Maps' Blaise Aguera y Arcas. "Maps, directions are really just one of them."</p>
