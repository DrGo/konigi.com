<p>He points out three characteristics of a hypnotic trigger:<br />
<ol><li>Uniqueness - it should be something (or a combination of things) you don't associate with other activities, otherwise the effect will be diluted.</li><br />
<li>Emotional intensity - the kind you experience when you're really immersed in creative work.</li><br />
<li>Repetition - the more times you experience the unique trigger in association with the emotions, the stronger the association becomes.</li></ol></p>

<p>I live by daily routines, but I also associate that with my need to feel balanced and in control of my time and the living and working space around me. I also have a tendency to be impulsive or to dive very deeply into activities, so routine acts both as clock and trigger.</p>

<p>There are some excellent anecdotes about the routines of famous creatives. I find myself really intrigued by the more eccentric ones, like those of Victor Hugo and especially that of Orhan Pamuk. Pamuk's act of re-creating his &quot;walk to work&quot; trigger is pretty ingenious. <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/7021/Why-Creative-People-Need-to-Be-Eccentric">Read more...</a></p>
