Dog eared pages never suited me, and the colored tabs I get at MUJI and the occasional PostIt note are OK. But I love the idea of these <a href="http://www.spoonsisters.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=100&amp;Product_Code=44308">magnetic page markers</a> from Folio because it means I won't need to buy anymore sticky tabs from the stationery store. And the little pointed arrows are pretty useful for pointing out lines of interest in books too. </p>
