This is a little zine I made from my Sketch talk.

I'm putting these in the package when people buy a sketchbook. I'll be sending one out soon to everyone who already purchased a book. Still working on setting up international shipping. :)

A little zine has been something I've always wanted to make. This is a zine in the traditional, DIY photocopy sense. It's not an art piece, as so many beautiful zines are these days. But maybe I'll make something more refined in the future.
