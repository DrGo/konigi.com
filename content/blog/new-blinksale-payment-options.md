They just announced a <a href="http://www.blinksale.com/2011/02/blinkpay-is-here/">new feature called BlinkPay</a> that will allow clients to pay invoice by credit card without you having to pay for an expensive merchant account. It's a nice alternative to PayPal. Some beautiful interface design work by Jared Christensen in there.</p>
