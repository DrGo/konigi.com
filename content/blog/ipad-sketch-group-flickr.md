<p>Because of <a href="http://twitter.com/fred_beecher/status/13004887399">@fred_beecher</a> I setup this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ipadsketch/">iPad Sketch Group</a> on Flickr so we can share our UI sketches. I'm going to slowly post what I work on there.</p>

<p><blockquote>Freehand design sketching on the iPad is for UX designers. Any app that lets you do freehand user interface sketches, either using finger tips or a capacitive stylus like the Pogo Sketch is what we're sharing here. If you drop non-iPad sketches, they will be booted.</p>

<p>Suggested tools to start: Autodesk Sketchbook Pro, Adobe Ideas, Penultimate, Brushes, OmniGraffle, Sundry Notes.</blockquote></p>
