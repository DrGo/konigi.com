<p>Userfocus provides some inspiration for <a href="http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/morae-pp.html">capturing paper prototype tests with Morae</a> and a webcam. Their method invovlves positioning the camera over the prototype, connect the cam directly to the PC, viewing the camera live in a video editor, and recording the output of the editor in Morae. </p>
<p>This method is ingenious. It gives you all of the agility of doing a paper prototype, with the flexbility and control of using Morae for the observation, note taking, and highlight reel creation.</p>
