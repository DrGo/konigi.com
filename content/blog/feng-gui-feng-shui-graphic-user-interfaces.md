<blockquote><p>Feng-GUI simulates human vision during the first 5 seconds of exposure to visuals,<br />
and creates heatmaps based on an algorithm that predicts what a real human would be most likely to look at.<br />
This offers designers, advertisers and creatives, a Pre-testing technology that predicts performance of an image, by analyzing levels of attention, brand effectiveness and placement, as well as breaking down the Flow of Attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure it's all that useful, and it certainly wouldn't replace usability testing or real click-tracking and eye-tracking. The examples imply that people only look ads and dark, saturated areas of color. Doesn't seem very realistic. Have you tried it? What do you think?</p>
