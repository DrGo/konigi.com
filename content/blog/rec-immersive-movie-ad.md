The site puts you into the movie as though you are watching video captured from an observer who is actually in the scene. There's a qality to the video and the storytelling here that feels very reminiscent of the <i>Blair Witch Project</i>, and here it is an equally successful vehicle. </p>
<p>After exploring and experiencing some of the terror for a few minutes, check out the video footage of <a href="http://www.recmovie.co.uk/flash/#/menu/preview_clips/audience_reaction">audience reactions</a> at a screening of the film. </p>
