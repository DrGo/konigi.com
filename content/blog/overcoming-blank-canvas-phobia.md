<p>Cameron Moll discusses <a href="http://cameronmoll.com/archives/2008/01/overcoming_blankcanvasphobia/">the issue of staring at a blank canvas</a> in Photoshop, and his approach to overcoming "blankcanvasphobia" and leaping into the design process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Familiarize yourself with how others have solved the same problem youâ€™re solving.</li>
<li>Draw from previous work.</li>
<li>Sketch it out</li>
<li>Begin with a grid</li>
<li>Begin in grayscale</li>
<li>Start with the "core."</li>
<li>If nothing sticks, come back later</li>
</ol>
