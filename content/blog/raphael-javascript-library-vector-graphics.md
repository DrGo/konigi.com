  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://raphaeljs.com/"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/raphaeljs.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>Henrik pointed me to Raphaël, a nice JS library for generating interactive charts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Raphaël is a small JavaScript library that should simplify your work with vector graphics on the web. In case you want to create your own specific chart or image crop-n-rotate widget, you can simply achieve it with this library.</p>
<p>Raphaël uses SVG and VML as a base for graphics creation. Because of that every created object is a DOM object so you can attach JavaScript event handlers or modify objects later. Raphaël’s goal is to provide an adapter that will make drawing cross-browser and easy.</p></blockquote>
