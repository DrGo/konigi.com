<p>On the Geniant blog, T.Scott Stromberg <a href="http://geniantsandbox.com/2008/02/28/the-fine-art-of-wireframes">exposes his craft of wireframe sketching</a>. I also spend most of my ideation time sketching. It's lovely to see other people's methods for getting ideas down. I love Stromberg's comments and comic book style.</p>
<p>This might sound kind of pathetic, but seeing the pens and paper he uses is the kind of thing I really geek out on. I love that he's pimping out the <a href="http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/Products/Dot-Grid-Book/9">Behance dot grid pads</a>. A designer gave me a pad of that stuff recently after I got him a leatherette <a href="http://www.vickerey.com/rhodia.html">Rhodia 3x4 case</a>. I carry one of those with me everywhere with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pentel-Twist-Erase-Automatic-Pencil-Black/dp/B00006IEH2/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;s=office-products&amp;qid=1207312018&amp;sr=1-10">Pentel  .7mm pencil</a>. When I sit down to work on a large project, though, I use the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters">Tufte 11x17 graph paper</a>, with the Pentel and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pigma-Micron-Pens-6-pk%252e/dp/B0008G8G8Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=office-products&amp;qid=1207312148&amp;sr=1-1">Micron</a>. I have to agree with his method of inking the sketches. I've gotten accustomed to doing that when I have to scan sketches to send to people, and tracing is something I'm used to doing from comic book sketching. </p>
<p>Another option to consider in a pinch, or if you can't stand to buy expensive paper, is to <a href="http://incompetech.com/graphpaper/plain/">print your own graph paper</a> with the graph paper pdf generator or download <a href="http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072532947/student_view0/grid_and_dot_paper.html">grid and graph paper from McGraw Higher Ed.</a> Will do paper up to 11 x 17 and lets you specify line weight and color. </p>
<p>I also created 2 different grid paper templates you can use. Download the PDFs at <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/konigi/notebook/8-5_x_11_grid_paper.pdf">8.5" x 11"</a> or <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/konigi/notebook/11_x_17_grid_paper.pdf">11" x 17"</a> that you can download.</p>
