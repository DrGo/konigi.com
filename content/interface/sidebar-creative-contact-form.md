<p>The contact page for this design agency features a clever use of an AJAX slider to allow potential clients to  for entering their budget in the range of 10K to 500K. Interesting that the slider increments in 25K's up to 100K, then increments in 100K's. Once you get them on the phone, I suppose you can give them your real budget. Maybe that helps eliminate small jobs?</p>
