<p>Huffduffer, a hybrid bookmarking/podcast service features a whimsical inline registration form that's formatted in sentences with blank areas that the user fills out with their name, password, etc. Kind of a fun, unexpected way to format the form. Reminds me of the kinds of forms you'd fill out by hand in days of old, which goes with the retro style of the site.</p>
