<p>Edward Pistachio is a writer pulping fine short stories. Consistent with the lighthearted tone of this site, he provides a contact form that is also all about words. Getting his email address requires solving a few jumbles, and then decoding the address from letters found in the jumbles. Sure it may be frustrating if you can't figure out the jumbles, and is one of the cleverest ways I've ever seen to gain access to a bit of info. And you can always Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=jumble+solver">jumble solver</a> if you're lazy like me. One thing that might make this even better is a validation check on each of the jumbles. Otherwise a very fun idea.</p>
