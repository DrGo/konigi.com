<p>By flipping the convention of labels on top or to the left of the inputs, Tubetorial provides a nicely aligned solution. We're accustomed to reading top to bottom and left to right, so it's a bit strange to have the label and input reversed this way. This works mainly because there are few inputs in a compressed area, but this might not be as efficient on large forms. </p>
