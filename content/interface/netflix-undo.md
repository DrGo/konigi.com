<p>Netflix offers an undo function in their Queue that allows users to undo a remove action. Users click an X icon to remove a movie from their queue, and the row is grayed out, showing an undo text link replacing the remove icon. The row persists until the user moves to a different page, so several removed rows may be visible if the user does repeated removes in one session. Upon return visits to the queue, the removed movies will be gone.</p>
<p>Prior to adding this function, clicking the remove control would simply remove the list from your queue, so if the user made a mistake, they would have to navigate back to the removed movie to add it back. The undo allows users to recover from mis-clicks or if they change their mind about watching that movie they just axed. </p>
