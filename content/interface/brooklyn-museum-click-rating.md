<p>The Brooklyn Museum's Click! show is a crowd-curated exhibition that accepted user submissions for photographs that reflect the theme, "The changing face of Brooklyn." Following the submission period, visitors are asked to help curate the photography show by evaluation submissions on their effectiveness at demonstrating the theme. The interface for evaluating photos steps the user through each entry and provides a slider control to rate the photo on a scle from most effective to least effective.</p>
