<p>SugarSync's web-based document management application allows users to manage files that are kept on their computers. The interactions for creating and moving folders use an identical design pattern for placing items in  a directory on the file system. This is similar to the Save As behavior in operating systems such as the Mac Finder and Windows Explorer, which will let users navigate to a disk drive, and then drill down deeply into a directory location.</p>
