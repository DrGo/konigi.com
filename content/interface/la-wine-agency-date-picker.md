<p>I like the design of the La Wine Agency site. The beautiful large type on the off-white paper reminds me of letterpress cards.</p>

<p>One thing I loved immediately was the age gate, which asks you when you were born so you can get through to shop for wine.</p>

<p>Not only is the big text for the month/day/year picker friendly, but that goofy headlines and &quot;When were you last born?&quot; copy is hilarious, if you catch the joke.</p>
