<p>The CBS site features a drop down menu that spans the entire width of the layout when the user hovers over shows. Wide drop downs are not unusual, and for a time appeared on the Amazon.com site when they experiencing the growth of their departments. On CBS, this type of interface is used to display as many of the network's shows as it can, segmenting them by airing time and format. </p>
<p>Below the navigation the site shows featured shows in a promotional module with a carousel UI. Lower down in the page, the featured and algorithmic lists of videos are presented in carousels as well.</p>
