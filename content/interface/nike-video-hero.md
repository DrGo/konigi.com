<p>Nike has been using a video player as hero graphic in the main Nike.com site. The player features large buttons for play controls and link to microsite (the button with the right angle quotes), star rating, playhead, low/high resolution and bandwidth switcher, a time elapse countdown, volume bars, and save/share options.</p>
