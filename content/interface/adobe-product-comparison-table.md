<p>Adobe's Creative Suite packages the company's graphics and motion products into families that can be purchased as a set. Because it can be difficult to determine which suite is right for the work you do, Adobe provides both a product comparison table with products and features listed in a chart, or a wizard questionnaire. </p>
