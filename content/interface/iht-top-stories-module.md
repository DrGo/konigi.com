<p>The International Herald Tribune site has, in my opinion, been the site that set the bar for clean, minimalist newspaper web sites since <a href="http://www.smokinggun.com/gallery.php">John Weir</a> worked on the design circa 2000/2001. The evolution of the site has continued to stick to Weir's minimalist visual style, although his innovative DHTML column and clipping behaviors are gone.</p>
<p>The top stories content module is an interface element that is a common feature in news sites. IHT implemented their module in as minimally as possible, providing 3 time slices beneath the header and a link to the RSS feed. Contrast this with <a href="newsweek-top-10-module.html">the top stories module provided by Newsweek</a>. I'm including this in the gallery because I think it demonstrates the type of simple presentation where the interface chrome gets out of the way so that users can get to what they need with no fuss.</p>
