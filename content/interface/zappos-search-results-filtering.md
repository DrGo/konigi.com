<p>The Zappos' search engine provides a nice results filtering interfaces that presents the user with facets for refining their search. The user can click on the terms at the top of the search results page to narrow the set, and a breadcrumb trail shows the selections they've made. Each term in the breadcrumb provides a checkbox to remove any one of those selections and broaden their search.</p>
